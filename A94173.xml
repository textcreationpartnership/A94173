            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

theſe papers which here we repreſent unto you. I had rather
indeed, if others had been of the ſame mind with me, that
they ſhould never have ſeen the light; for the proof whereof
this may be one Argument, and of force enough, that part
of theſe Lectures, written by me ſome y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did efflagitate, that I would preſent thoſe things to
the eys of all men to be read, which heretofore in reading

how acuter was the judgement of the eye than of the ear did
conſtantly deny it; They, on the other ſide, were more inſtant
with me, and more vehemently did urge me, and (as oft in
like caſes it comes to paſs) they did gently chide me; But I,
who was reſolved to be obſtinate, ſtood fixed to my ſelf; for
whatſoever they could object unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was ready always
to anſwer them, that a work begun (and not half of it, nor
the third part of it peradventure hardly accompliſhed) was
not raſhly to be communicated to the publick; But they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
were as ready to reply, <hi>Why ceaſe you then? Why do
you not ſet your ſelf cloſe unto your ſtudy, and put your
laſt hand unto that work which your firſt hand hath ſo
happily begun?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay for my ſelf in this caſe? I am aſhamed

(and what was too true indeed) that unleſs ſome <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

that they would be publiſhed by ſome one elſe, I not knowing

utterly unknown unto me the candour of his mind and his
reverent respect to Equity; eſpecially being of their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who almoſt do make their gain their only buſineſſe. I
therefore wrote back unto him to ſend me one of the Copies,
that ſeemed to him to be the faireſt of the two, and the moſt

what was needful to be done. To be ſhort, he ſent it I did

nothing perfect; for beſides the innumerable faults of the
Tranſcriber, not a few things which in my firſt meditation
were written by my ſelf with too haſty a Pen, did ſeem, as
they indeed ought, to be called back again to the Anvel and
the Hammer. Hence I perceived I was to undergo a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome

FIRST LECTURE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
In which the Definition of Conſcience

very great,<note n="a" place="margin">Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro <hi>pro</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> either in the reſpect
of <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Confidence,</hi> hath been
of old declared by wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, and more neerly and
abundantly atteſted by the ſence
and the experience of all Men. It is therefore
the more to be lamented that many (while greedily
they imploy all their ſtudies in the knowledge of
things indifferent) are in ſo dark an ignorance in the
knowledge of their own Conſciences, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is no where to be found, a more faithful
Admoniſher, or a more diligent Accuſer, or a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154344:13"/>
Witneſſe, or an uncorrupter Judge, or a
ſweeter Comforter, or a more importunate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
That therefore I may inſtill into the Minds
and Ears of the ingenious, that old, and ſo often
repeated inſtruction <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>Know
thy ſelf,</hi> and divert them a little from the too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
deſire of a more unprofitable knowledge,
gradually by inviting them to a greater care and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of their Conſciences; I thought it would be a
work worth the labour, if I ſhould a little more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
inquire into the uſe, &amp; Nature of Conſcience,
and in this place, according to my obligations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to you, my Auditors, thoſe Meditations
which I ſhall find moſt obſervable on this Subject. I
have determined therefore in this firſt Lecture to lay
open the Nature of Conſcience by defining it, and
in my following Lectures, by the Almighties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
I will expound unto you the uſe and office
of the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> eſpecially as it reflecteth on
things to be done, and that in a double reſpect:
the firſt, to the rule of the Law to which it ought to
be Subject, and the other in reſpect to former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
over which it is ordained to govern.</p>
            <p>II. But the method of defining being twofold,
the one <hi>Synthetical,</hi> or by the way of Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when by due weighing of every part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
the definition at laſt is perfectly collected:
the other <hi>Analytical,</hi> and by way of reſolution
which doth take aſunder every peice of the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and open and unfold that, which at firſt was
propounded entire; Although the former may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
ſeem more convenient to the order of
Nature, yet I have made choice of the latter, which
I conceive more fit for inſtruction. Thus therefore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154344:13"/>
I do briefly define Conſcience. <hi>Conſcience is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
or a habit of the practical underſtanding, by
which the mind of Man doth by the diſcourſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
apply that light with which he is indued to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
moral Actions.</hi> In this definition two things
do preferre themſelves to obſervation. Firſt, the
name of the thing defined, which is the voyce of
the Conſcience it ſelf. Secondly, the particular
members of the definition, which are all thoſe that
are ordinary in the definition of the qualities of the
firſt and ſecond <hi>Species;</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Genus,</hi> the
<hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>Object,</hi> and the <hi>proper Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. As to the Name of the thing defined, it is
obſerved by learned men that in all the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there is not found a Hebrew word which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely,
and peculiarly doth ſignifie the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
But the Hebrews, according to their cuſtom
of ſpeaking, as often as mention is made of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
they make uſe of one of thoſe two words to
expreſſe it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the firſt whereof is
known by all to ſignifie the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the other
the <hi>Spirit of Man.</hi> According to this is that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
in the fourth of <hi>Proverbs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Keep thy Heart
with all diligence,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Le</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one have a diligent care of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
And in the ſeventh of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old interpretation the words are,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Thy
Conſcience knoweth that thou thy ſelf hath often curſed
others;</hi> And according unto the Tranſlation of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius,
thy Mind is Conſcious;</hi> It is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Text <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, Thy Heart knoweth, And
in the new Teſtament, eſpecially in St. <hi>John,</hi> in
whoſe writings there are many Hebraiſms; the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Heart is often put for the <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:154344:14"/>
as <hi>John</hi> 1 3.<note place="margin">1 John 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21.</note> 
               <hi>If our heart condemneth us not,</hi> that is
if our Conſcience doth condemn us not, it being the
proper office of the conſcience to condemn, or not to
condemn the guilty perſon ſtanding before the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of Juſtice; From this proceeds that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
alluſion of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and others; <hi>Conſcientia
quaſi cordis ſcientia,</hi> The Conſcience is the hearts
conſciouſneſs. The conſcience alſo in the holy
Scripture oftentimes by the Hebrews and the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
is called and expreſſed by the name of Spirit;
I will only inſtance two places, for what needs any
more in a thing ſo evident: In the Old Teſtament
<hi>Proverbs</hi> the 18 and the fourteenth verſe, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of man will ſuſtain his infirmity, but a broken Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
who can endure?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, a man of a
ſound and unſtained conſcience will endure with as
much courage as patience whatſoever calamities
ſhall befall him, but an afflicted and guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is a burden inſupportable. And then in the new
Teſtament, I ſhall make uſe of that of St. <hi>Paul, 1
Cor.</hi> 2. 11. which is the Theme and foundation of
this preſent diſcourſe. <hi>What man knoweth the things
of a man, but the Spirit of man which is in him.</hi> That
is his own Conſcience.</p>
            <p>IIII. But moſt certain it is that the Latin word
<hi>Conſcientia,</hi> Conſcience and the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which in all things is moſt reſponſible to the Latin,
did both of them receive their de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivations <hi>a ſciendo,</hi>
from knowing; but a praepoſition being added to
both the words in the pronunciation of them, doth
ſeem to imply more then can hereby be contained
in the ſingle word <hi>Science;</hi> but ſeveral Authors
do give a ſeveral ſignification of it. To omit thoſe
two alluſions that by many are alleadged, (which if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154344:14"/>
we look on the nature of the thing it ſelf, may
peradventure be retained as altogether not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but if brought to the exactneſs of a lawfull exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
will preſently appeare but vain and not
worthy to be inſiſted on.) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Conſcientia eſt
quaſi cordis ſcientia,</hi> Conſcience is no more than the
hearts conſciouſnes; And <hi>Conſcientia quaſi conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
ſcientia;</hi> Conſcience is as it were a concluding
Science: It is moſt certain that thoſe two words
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Conſcientia,</hi> beyond the bare notion
of a Science, have a certain order and relation of
<hi>that</hi> ſcience to another; for ſuch is the force of the
two particles, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Con,</hi> that in their compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they imply a certain conjunction and an aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many things, ſo that this word <hi>Conſcientia</hi>
or Conſcience may be ſaid to be <hi>conjuncta multorum
ſcientia,</hi> a conjoyned ſcience of many things, which
two ways may be underſtood; For it may be ſaid to
be the ſcience of many things, in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as the ſcience or the knowledge of many men
that do know; as when many perſons do know the
ſame thing: or in reſpect of the objects, when it is
the knowledge of many things that are known, as
when the ſame perſon knows many things alike.
Let the word Conſcience be taken either in the one
ſence or the other, the account of the word neither
much borrowed nor incongruous may be given, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we look on the thing it ſelf, or the uſe and
manner of ſpeaking amongſt approved Authors.</p>
            <p>V. For in the firſt place when many men know
the ſame thing, they may be ſaid to be conſcious of
it, and to know it altogether; So thoſe whom <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi>
had choſen into the ſociety of his wickedneſs,
and were made partakers of his counſels, were ſaid
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154344:15"/>
to be conſcious of that conſpiracy. And he is ſaid
to be conſcious of the Kings ſecrets, to whom his

A Conſcious witneſs, and a helper to me in all my
counſels and dangers. I ſhould here be infinite if
I ſhould collect whatſoever to this purpoſe I every
where do meet with in the Authors of greateſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
But that may ſerve which already is alledged,
unleſs peradventure you exact of me to produce
ſomething from the puddle of the Grammarians which
may conduce to this purpoſe; I will do it, not that
the authority of thoſe men is ſo much to be valued,
but becauſe in theſe things they ſeem as it were by
right to arrogate a kind of pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eminence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
In the firſt place, hear <hi>Nonius, In hoc diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>Scius &amp; conſcius, ſcius ſecum, conſcius
cum alio ſcius eſt,</hi> That is, the knowing or ſcious man
doth differ in this fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conſcious; the ſcious knows
by himſelf, the Conſcious is ſcious with another.</p>
            <p>From this original of the word, they who thought
that Conſcience was ſo called as one Science with
another, doe give this reaſon for their opinion,
that man not only knows what things he hath
committed, but he hath God who ſearcheth the heart
and the reins, to be a conſcious witneſs and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector
into all his works, nay, into his moſt ſecret
thoughts, And this is moſt certain, though words be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154344:15"/>
tongue-tyed, and the Voyce be dumb. Behold
my witneſſe is in the Heavens, and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> my
Record that is conſcious of me is on high: <hi>Job.</hi> 16.
19. The bleſſed Apoſtle alſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the ninth
of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the firſt, when he had called on
God to be the witneſſe of the truth he was about
to ſpeak, he preſently ſubnecteth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
my Conſcience bearing me witneſſe;
As if he ſhould have ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Chriſt knows it, and I know it with him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Chriſt doth teſtify it,
and my Conſcience doth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſt it with him. Let
this therefore be the firſt reaſon of the derivation
of the word, that Conſcience is ſo called, becauſe the
deeds of Man are known unto God, as well as to
himſelf.</p>
            <p>VI. In another ſence the Conſcience is called
the <hi>conjoyned Science</hi> of many things, as of <hi>Objects,</hi>
or of things that are known, when a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
many things at once, or (which ſtrikes on the
ſame ſtring) when he conjoyneth and joyntly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
the knowledges of ſeveral things, that are in
themſelves diſtinct. From whence proceedeth this
ſecond reaſon of the word, which pleaſed much St.
<hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> and a great part of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and which ſeeming to be deſervedly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
above the other already mentioned, doth bear
no unprofitable light to illuſtrate the Nature and
the force of Conſcience, which is, that <hi>Conſcience</hi> is
ſo called, becauſe it addeth <hi>Science</hi> unto <hi>Science,</hi>
that is, the univerſal knowledge, or the knowledge
of Law, and Right, to the particular knowledge,
or the knowledge of the fact by applying one unto
the other; I ſhall make this more manifeſt to you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154344:16"/>
by one or by two examples, in the firſt of <hi>Samuel</hi>
the 24 Chapter, and the 50 Verſe, it is ſaid that
<hi>Davids</hi> Heart did fail him, after that in the Cave he
had cut off the wing of <hi>Sauls</hi> Garment, that is to
ſay, his Conſcience did prick him; for we may i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
that <hi>David</hi> thus reaſoned within himſelf; I
know that I ought not to offer any violence to the
Sacred Perſon of the King, I know alſo that very
lately I have done that which commeth very near
unto violence; I am afraid therefore that I have
done that, which peradventure I ought not to have
done, and I give thanks unto God who held back my
hand from acting that which certainly I ought not
to have committed. In this manner alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of <hi>Judas</hi> the Betrayer did object unto him:
Thou knoweſt that thou oughteſt not to betray thy
Maſter, and thou knoweſt that moſt baſely thou
haſt done it. The ſence and knowledge of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
fact either committed, or to be committed,
comming in this manner to the univerſal knowledge
of Law and Right which is in the mind, and being
conjoyned, and applyed, and wholly reflecting on it,
there ariſeth from thence all <hi>that</hi> which we call <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
The words which by way of Reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are expreſſed, and are moſt frequent in this
kind, do confirm this derivation of the name of
Conſcience,<note place="margin">Iſocrat. <hi>ad</hi> Dem.</note> of which nature is that of <hi>Iſocrates,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

to conclude all, of the ſame ſence, is that of St <hi>Paul,
1 Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, I am conſcious to

            <p>VII. I do believe that it is now manifeſt to you
from whence the word <hi>Conſcience</hi> is derived,
and it is left to your choyce to preferr the one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
or the other, or to receive them both
with an equal approbation. The other Reaſons
which the common Schoolmen, according to their
own capacities, do produce, are too weak to ſtop
the progreſſe of this diſcourſe, of which there are
many things that are yet remayning to be ſpoken.
I proceed therefore to open to you the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or
the cognomination of the word, from whence
there ariſeth amongſt grave Authors ſo wonderful a
difference in the definition, that as yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
is high, and difficult concerning the very
firſt Term of the definition to find out what is
the <hi>Genus</hi> of it. To remove therefore all Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity,
it is in the firſt place obſervable, that there
is ſuch an affinity, by nature, of the Indowments
of the mind, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Potentia's, Habits,</hi> and
<hi>Acts,</hi> and ſo near a conjunction, ſo cloſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,
according to the uſe and exerciſe of them,
that not only the appellations of words, but the
offices, and real proprieties of every one of them,
are promiſcuouſly, and without any diſtinction at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to one another, and that not only in the
Rhetorical expreſſions of the Poets and Orators,
and others the Profeſſors of Humane Literature,
to whom a Liberty was permitted; but even in the
Dogmatical poſitions of the Philoſophers and
Schoolmen themſelves, who were denyed that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
elegancy. Nevertheleſſe, although it was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154344:17"/>
alwayes accounted a great task, in their own certain
bounds, to define and diſtinguiſh of things ſo united
by Uſe and Nature; yet as to the word <hi>Conſcience</hi>
which is a kind of Science, and ſo named from it,
it will be no little advantage to us, in this place a
little more preciſely to explain the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of this word <hi>Science,</hi> that ſo, by the
manifold uſe of the ſingle word, the ambiguity of
the compounded may more rightly, and more
throughly be underſtood.</p>
            <p>VIII. In the firſt place therefore (as the Names
of <hi>Habits</hi> do familiarly paſſe into their <hi>Objects)
Science</hi> is taken in a double conſideration, <hi>formally</hi>
and <hi>objectively.</hi> And as the Divines do diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of <hi>Faith,</hi> that, <hi>Faith</hi> by which we do believe,
which is a <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> exiſting in the mind, is
one thing; and that the <hi>Faith</hi> which we do believe,
which is no more than a thing believed by <hi>Faith,</hi>
and but the <hi>object</hi> of the former, and <hi>extrinſical</hi> to
it, is another thing; the firſt whereof may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Faith formally,</hi> and the or the but <hi>objectively:</hi> ſo
in the ſame manner we may diſtinguiſh of <hi>Science,</hi>
and conſequently of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that they are taken
either properly, and formally, for the very <hi>Habit</hi>
of the Mind by which we know ſomething our
ſelves, or acknowledge it with others; or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and objectively for that thing it ſelf which
we know, and know that others do know it with
us. In which latter and improper ſence, the Law
which is written in our Hearts, and is as it were a
rule of well living may be called <hi>Conſcience;</hi> And in
this ſence is that to be underſtood, which is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repeated in the Schools of <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is the Law of the Mind,</hi> when indeed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:154344:17"/>
is not properly and formally the Law of the
mind, but rather an object of the Conſcience either
adaequate or in part.</p>
            <p>IX. Secondly, Seeing theſe three things <hi>Potentia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s,
Habits,</hi> and <hi>Acts,</hi> are pertaining to the Soul, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
diſtinct in themſelves, they are yet ordinated to
one another, <hi>Potentia's,</hi> as the natural vertues of
the ſoul it ſelf, <hi>Habits,</hi> as formes perfecting thoſe
<hi>Potentia's,</hi> &amp; enabling them for the more ready, &amp;
the more pleaſant exerciſing of their <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi>
which are the exerciſings as much as the <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's,</hi>
as the <hi>Habits,</hi> as the names of <hi>Science,</hi> and of
<hi>Conſcience</hi> doe in ſome meaſure extend it ſelf to
all theſe. For as the Carpenter is ſaid to cut, or
hew, firſt with his Axe as his Inſtrument, ſecondly,
with the edge of the Axe, as the formal diſpoſition
of the inſtrument, and thirdly, with the cutting or
hewing it ſelf, as the uſe and action of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
in the ſame manner the mind of man may be
ſaid to know; Firſt, with the <hi>Potentia</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the Inſtrument, Secondly, with the <hi>Habit</hi> of
knowing, as a diſpoſition that brings that <hi>Potentia</hi> to
perfection; and thirdly, with an <hi>actual conſideration</hi> as
with the uſe, &amp; operation of the <hi>Potentia</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</hi>
Science hereupon is taken in threefold reſpect
<hi>Subjectively, formally</hi> &amp; <hi>effectively.</hi> Firſt <hi>Subjectively,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
for the <hi>Pote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tia</hi> in whom it is and which it is apt to
bring to perfection, as every <hi>form</hi> in ſome meaſure
doth perfect its <hi>Subject;</hi> For example, when we
ſay, that the myſteries of Faith do exceed our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
the meaning is, that they exceed
the meaſure of our <hi>cognitive power.</hi> Secondly, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
(the moſt uſual ſignification of this word)
for the <hi>Habit</hi> of knowledge, either <hi>innate,</hi> or <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite;</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:154344:18"/>
in the ſame ſence we are ſaid to know <hi>principles</hi>
known by themſelves, and <hi>concluſions</hi> by a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
diſcourſe of reaſon deduced from them, and
univerſally all things of which by the aſſiſtance of
ſence, and reaſon, we have any certainty. Thirdly,
Effectively, for the actual conſideration of things
before known; In which ſence (to touch upon
it by the way) the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, in
the 23 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the 5 verſe (in the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, Interpreters have wonderfully perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves) are abſolutely to be underſtood.
<hi>Brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I knew not that it was the
high Prieſt,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, <hi>I did not think, I did not
diligently enough conſider of it.</hi> As if he ſhould have
ſaid; Brethren, pardon my juſt indignation, if tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the heat of a troubled Spirit I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſomething more liberally than what became me,
being at that inſtant forgetfull of his place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and of my duty, I ought not to revile the High
Prieſt, although he hath done ſomething unworthy of
the honour of it; but the exilience of my paſſion did
prepoſſeſſe me from giving that reſpect unto him,
which by a more attentive deliberation I ſhould have
done. This is the ſence of the Apoſtle in that
place, and it is as eaſie, as it is proper and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>X. But I proceed, as <hi>Science,</hi> ſo <hi>Conſcience</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is taken in three ſeveral wayes or acceptations
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt <hi>Subjectively,</hi> for the intellective, practical
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> power, as when we ſay that the Law of Nature is
written in the heart or the <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Secondly;
<hi>Formally</hi> for the <hi>Habit</hi> pertaining to that <hi>Potentia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
and informing it; In the ſame ſence, making menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a perſon notoriouſly wicked, we ſay he is a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154344:18"/>
man of no conſcience, &amp; that he hath either thrown
off or loſt all conſcience, Thirdly <hi>Effectively,</hi> for any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
actual motion, exerciſe, or operation of that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;</hi>
as when a man ſaith that he is conſcious of this,
or that fact; In which ſenſe is that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
the firſt Book, ſecond Chapter, and 19 verſe. <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man for his conſcience to God doth ſuffer troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XI. Again, ſeeing that <hi>Conſcience</hi> is properly
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or a knowledge Syllogiſticall, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that all who do treat of the nature and the
method of it do conceive that it cannot more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or more aptly be illuſtrated than by a practical
Syllogiſm; It is to be obſerved that the word <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
in the very ſame reſpect doth fall under a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
conſideration. Firſt, and moſt properly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
for the preciſe knowledge of the <hi>concluſion,</hi>
and thus it is taken by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyticks</hi>
and many other places, Secondly, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
knowledge of <hi>Principles</hi> from which concluſions are
demonſtrated, as if a man ſhould ſay he knoweth
that <hi>Omne totum eſt majus qualibet ſui parte, Every
thing that is whole is more and greater than any part
thereof.</hi> Thirdly for the knowledge of the whole ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
for he who knoweth the premiſes, and the
Concluſion, doth know the whole argumentation.
Fourthly, for the aggregated knowledge of many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
concluſions or demonſtrations pertaining to one
Subject; in the ſame ſence we are ſaid to know na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philoſophy, Geometry, Phyſick &amp;c. The very
ſame is to be affirmed of conſcience whoſe full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
many Authors do comprehend in one practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Syllogiſm. But <hi>Conſcience</hi> (as is already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
being a conjoyned Science, that all which
comes under this name may more fully, and as it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154344:19"/>
were at one ſight be diſcerned: the whole buſineſſe
(as I conceive) will more commodiouſly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
if we ſhall frame the whole diſcourſe of
Conſcience ſo to conſiſt of two Syllogiſms, that the
concluſion of the firſt Syllogiſme be the Major pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Every thing that is unjuſt is to be eſchewed,</item>
               <item>Every Theft is unjuſt, <hi>therefore</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Every Theft is to be eſchewed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Let this be the firſt Syllogiſm, the firſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof is known of it ſelf by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>Reaſon</hi> doth prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
doth bring in the concluſion; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
it preſently takes up to be the beginning of
the following Syllogiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and applying it to ſome
particular Fact, accordingly as the Will ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
unto it, it argues in this manner.</p>
            <list>
               <item>All Theft is to be eſchewed.</item>
               <item>This which is now propounded to me to be done is</item>
               <item>a Theft, <hi>therefore</hi> it is to be eſchewed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And the Name of the Vice being changed, it
proceedeth in this manner, as often as it judgeth of
any paſt particular Fact.</p>
            <p>XII. Theſe things being thus ſtated, I ſay that
<hi>Conſcience</hi> as well as <hi>Science</hi> is taken four wayes;

the courſe of both Syllogiſms, as that, in which the
laſt Judgem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of the <hi>practical underſtanding</hi> is
contained. As if a Man ſhould ſay, my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth ſuggeſt unto me that this Theft is not to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154344:19"/>
be committed, or my Conſcience cryeth out unto
me, that it ought not to be committed; And the
knowledge of this concluſion is properly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or
Conſcience, as it is diſtinct from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>or a
guiltleſſe conſervation of ones ſelf.</hi> Secondly it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
for the knowledge of that firſt univerſal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
known by the light of Nature, or Revelation on
which the whole thred of this diſcourſe depends;
As if a Man ſhould ſay, my Conſcience dictates to
me that no unjuſt thing is to be done. The word
<hi>Syntereſis</hi> which is a guiltleſſe converſation of ones ſelf,
is often uſed for <hi>Syneideſis</hi> or Conſcience, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
as in this and ſuch like expreſſions; The
<hi>Conſcience</hi> is nothing elſe but a <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> or a
guiltleſſe conſervation of the mind from falling
into any Vice, when indeed between <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> and
Conſcience properly ſo called, there is no little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
for there is as great a diverſity betwixt this
<hi>Syntereſis,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> properly ſo called, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Science,</hi> and the <hi>Habit</hi> of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> which are
two habits of the mind ſpecifically diſtinct as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
we have read in the fifth of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Ethicks.
As therefore in Speculatives, <hi>Intelligence</hi> is a habit
of the firſt principles, about <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> from
whence concluſions are deduced, out of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
<hi>Science;</hi> So in practicks, <hi>Syntereſis</hi> is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of the firſt principles, about <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill,</hi> from
whence concluſions are deduced, out of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
Conſcience. Thirdly <hi>Conſcience</hi> is taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
more largely for that whole practical diſcourſe of the
mind, from the firſt beginning to the laſt concluſion
which is contained in two ſuch ſyllogiſms, as a little
above I have propounded to you, and in its circuit
comprehendeth <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> and <hi>Syneideſis</hi> alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154344:20"/>
ſo called. For a mans Conſcience doth eaſily
ſuggeſt unto him all theſe things viz. that no unjuſt
thing ought to be done, and that Theft is deſervedly
ranked amongſt thoſe Crimes which do carry on
them the face of injuſtice, and that this particular
act which is by me now committed, or which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
doth tempt me to commit, is the guilt of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Theft. Fourthly Conſcience is taken for the aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
knowledge of many particular acts of which the
whole account of our life and converſation doth
conſiſt; In which ſenſe thoſe words of the Apoſtle
do ſeem to be underſtood; Men and Brethren in all
good Conſcience <gap reason="foreign">

with God unto this day, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1. To the ſame
ſence is that of the Author of the Hebrews, <hi>Cap. 13.
ver.</hi> 18. we do aſſure our ſelves we have a good
Conſcience deſiring to converſe honeſtly with all
men; and that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the firſt Book, third
Chapter, and fifteenth verſe, where (as a godly and
learned man hath obſerved) that which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the verſe is called a good Conſcience,
the very ſame thing in the end of the ſame verſe is
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a good converſation, for as
often as we do praiſe and diſpraiſe any one, to be a
man of a good or a bad Conſcience, it is by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether on his manners, and dayly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without reſpect to any particular fact he hath
committed.</p>
            <p>XIII. I have expounded theſe things more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I confeſſe, then at the firſt I determined, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
then you expected; but I preſume you
will be more favourable to me, if it ſhall appear
that this prolixity in explaining the <hi>thing defined,</hi>
will be the means to make the reſt of the treatiſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154344:20"/>
more compendious, I ſhall now proceed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Definition of Conſcience it ſelf,
and give you an account of every part, and member
thereof; I ſhall only praeadvertiſe this, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is clear of it ſelf) that the Definition which
before I gave you of Conſcience, doth adaequately
pertain to <hi>Conſcience properly ſo called,</hi> As it is taken
for the knowledge of the laſt <hi>Concluſion,</hi> of a <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Syllogiſm,</hi> nevertheleſſe with the due permutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome words it may ſerve to explain the other
ſignifications as uſually it is done in almoſt all other
words which <hi>Analogically are aequivocall. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of Conſcience,</hi> which I ſhall repeat again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of many other things ſince intervening, is this,
<hi>Conſcience is a faculty or a Habit of the practical under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by which the mind of man by the diſcourſe of
reaſon doth apply the light with which it is indued to
its particular moral acts.</hi> In this <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> theſe
four things are contained, which by themſelves are
ſeverally, and ſingly to be expounded, <hi>viz. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
the Subject, the Object, and the Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIIII. There is a great and fierce controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the School-men concerning the <hi>Genus</hi> of
<hi>Conſcience;</hi> But in the firſt place they do all agree
that Conſcience pertaineth to the mind of man, but
whether to the <hi>Potentia,</hi> or the <hi>Habit,</hi> or the <hi>Act,</hi>
thereof, is a wonderfull diſſention. <hi>Aquinas</hi> who in

               </note> doth
ſtate it to be an <hi>Act;</hi> whoſe opinion many have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
and not only the School-men, who are
ſwayed (as I believe,) more by the authority
of ſo great a man, then convinced by his reaſons, but
the <hi>Divines</hi> alſo of the <hi>reformed Churches,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Aqui. 1. qu. 97. 13.</note> out of a
faſtidiouſneſs to that contentious generation, had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154344:21"/>
rather in theſe things follow the moſt received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
(if cleer from all tincture of prophaneſſe,
and ſuperſtition) then to make too curious a ſearch
into their thorny ſubtilities. But if I may freely
expreſs my ſelf, this moſt common opinion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to be diſproved, and to overthrow it there
needs no other argument then this. In Conſcience
there are very many <hi>Acts;</hi> It <hi>dictates,</hi> it <hi>forceth,</hi> it
<hi>holdeth,</hi> it <hi>teſtifies,</hi> it <hi>excuſeth,</hi> it <hi>accuſeth,</hi> it <hi>comforts,</hi>
it <hi>gnaweth,</hi> it <hi>tormenteth, &amp;c.</hi> But of <hi>Acts</hi> there are
no <hi>Acts,</hi> but of <hi>Forms, Potentia's</hi> and <hi>Habits;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Conſcience of neceſſity muſt be, a <hi>Forme,</hi> or a
<hi>Potentia,</hi> or a <hi>Habit,</hi> but no <hi>Act.</hi> To the argument
of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and thoſe that follow him <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Conſcience</hi> is <hi>an application of the knowledge</hi> or
<hi>light</hi> which is in the <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> or the unſtained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the mind, and that every <hi>application</hi> is
an <hi>Act;</hi> I anſwer that the word <hi>Conſcience</hi> (as may
appear by what is already ſpoken) is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Effectively</hi> for ſome certain Act of it, in the
ſame manner as the word of <hi>Science</hi> is taken for an
<hi>actual conſideration,</hi> but improperly. For to ſpeak
properly, the <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Science</hi> or <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
is not <hi>Conſcience</hi> it ſelf, but an <hi>Act</hi> of it; as <hi>conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
is not <hi>Science or Knowledge,</hi> but an <hi>Act</hi> of it,
therefore <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not an <hi>Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XV. It muſt be therefore a <hi>Power,</hi> or a <hi>Habit;</hi>
for that it is not a <hi>Form,</hi> (to wit the Soul it ſelf,
but ſomething of it) is confeſſed by all men: there
are many of the <hi>Moderns</hi> who do deny it to be a
<hi>Habit,</hi> and labour to prove it to be a <hi>Potentia,</hi> and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thus they diſpute it. Firſt, becauſe it is a kind of
<hi>Memory,</hi> for the <hi>Intellect</hi> reflecting on things <hi>Agible,</hi>
that is, on things done, or to be done, hath a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154344:21"/>
to the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as the <hi>Intellect</hi> reflecting on
things <hi>ſpeculable,</hi> hath its relation to the <hi>Memory.</hi>
And it is ſufficiently known that the <hi>Memory</hi> is a
<hi>Potentia,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> and not a <hi>Habit.</hi> Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the <hi>Potentia</hi> is that by which the faculty <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is primitively enabled to Act; Now, by <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
a man is able to dictate to himſelf what is to
be done, and either to approve or to diſprove what
hath been performed by it, and that in the firſt place;
becauſe, let him admit but of the Conſcience, he can
do all theſe, take away the Conſcience, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do them. Thirdly, becauſe it is <hi>contradistinct</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to another <hi>Potentia</hi> as <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. where <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Mind</hi> and the <hi>Conſcience</hi> are openly
deſcribed as oppoſite <hi>Species;</hi> It is therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
according to the rules of contrary <hi>Species,</hi>
that they both muſt have one, and the ſame <hi>Genus,</hi>
now the mind is a <hi>Potentia;</hi> and therefore ſo muſt
the <hi>Conſcience</hi> be alſo. Moreover it is abundantly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
proved that the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not a <hi>Habit,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſeemeth to be as natural to a man, as the
<hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> &amp; becauſe it is found in all; even
in Infants and Sucklings, by a certain inſtinct of
Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at that Age when they do not ſeem to
be capable of <hi>Habits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XVI. <hi>Scotils</hi> nevertheleſs, &amp; <hi>Durand,</hi> &amp; ſome others
of the moſt ſubtile School-men, are of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a <hi>Habit,</hi> &amp; to ſpeak the
truth, their judgment is grounded on no contemti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
arguments; Firſt, becauſe that <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a
kind of <hi>Science,</hi> whereupon the very ſame Acts are
attributed to it, as to <hi>know,</hi> and not to <hi>know.</hi> And
thus in the 7 <hi>Eccleſi. 23. Scit conſcientia tua,</hi> thy
Conſcience knows; And in the 43 of <hi>Gen. 22.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154344:22"/>
Neſcimus quis repoſuerit pecuniam noſtram in faccis
noſtris,</hi> we know not who did put our mony into our
ſacks, where the vulgar tranſlation reades it, <hi>Non
eſt in conſcientia noſtra,</hi> It is not in our Conſciences.
<hi>Nil mihi conſcius ſum</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>) in the 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. I am conſcious to my ſelf, that I am faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in nothing, but <hi>Science</hi> is a <hi>Habit</hi> and therefore
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Secondly, becauſe by the <hi>right inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the <hi>new information</hi> and <hi>illumination</hi> of the
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> a man is enabled to do that, to which he
was before unable, but by the acceſſe of the ſame
<hi>illumination,</hi> there is no new <hi>Potentia</hi> ingendred in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Soul, but rather a new <hi>Habit.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe
from meer <hi>Potentia's,</hi> no man is morally denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
either <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> but from the <hi>Habits,</hi>
neither is he prais'd or diſprais'd for <hi>Potentia's,</hi> but
for the <hi>Habits;</hi> but men are ſaid to be <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi>
and are either prais'd, or diſprais'd for the quality
of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> therefore Conſcience is a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, becauſe it is not proper unto <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's,</hi>
but to <hi>Habits,</hi> to be <hi>obtained,</hi> to be <hi>aſſumed,</hi>
to be <hi>layd down,</hi> or to be <hi>loſt;</hi> but men are ſaid to
<hi>find,</hi> to <hi>loſe,</hi> to <hi>take up,</hi> and to <hi>depoſe</hi> their <hi>Conſciences.</hi>
The <hi>Conſcience</hi> therefore is not a <hi>Potentia,</hi> but a
<hi>Habit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XVII. I do therefore thus ſtate it. The Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> and by a <hi>direct praedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is a <hi>Habit,</hi> yet notwithſtanding it may be a <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
and that two ways, firſt <hi>materially,</hi> becauſe it
is in the <hi>Potentia</hi> as in the Subject, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is to
ſay <hi>in which;</hi> Secondly by <hi>approximation,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
placed as it were in the midſt, betwixt <hi>Habitum
acquiſitum,</hi> and <hi>puram potentiam</hi> a <hi>Habit</hi> acquired,
and a <hi>pure potentia,</hi> it can aſſume the name of either,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154344:22"/>
as the <hi>Mediums</hi> do participate of either of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
And hereupon it is that Conſcience is
found in little Children, who are not capable of <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Habits;</hi> Neither is it altogether neceſſary
that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>mind,</hi> and the <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. be contradiſtinct as <hi>bare Potentia's,</hi> but it
ſeems rather that both words are there taken by a
<hi>Synecdoche;</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> for <hi>the ſpeeulative Intellect
with all its pertinences,</hi> as the Schoolmen ſpeak it,
and the <hi>Conſcience</hi> for the <hi>practicall Intellect</hi> with
<hi>all its pertinences,</hi> that is, with all the <hi>faculties, Habits,</hi>
and <hi>Acts,</hi> and what do reſpectively pertain to any
of them.</p>
            <p>XVIII. In the <hi>Definition of Conſcience,</hi> I have
placed the word <hi>Faculty,</hi> which in ſome meaſure
doth ſeem to me to be common to the <hi>Potentia's</hi>
and <hi>Habits,</hi> and is very proper to ſignifie <hi>Habits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi>
Peradventure you will object, that every <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi>
is acquired by often actings, and therefore this
doth ſo appertain to the eſſence of a <hi>Habit</hi> that
<hi>Habits</hi> are eſpecially to be known from <hi>Potentia's</hi>
by it, as by a <hi>ſpecifical difference,</hi> to wit, that the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia's</hi>
are accquired, and the <hi>Habits</hi> natural, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unleſs a man will maintain meer contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he ought not to ſay that Conſcience is a <hi>Habit
innate.</hi> To this I anſwer, that it muſt be indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that all <hi>Habits</hi> whatſoever, both are, and
ought to be called <hi>accquired,</hi> nay even thoſe <hi>Habits</hi>
which ſeem to be moſt <hi>natural,</hi> and for this cauſe,
becauſe they want the aſſiſtance of the <hi>ſences,</hi> and
many praevious ſenſible actions that ſo the <hi>Species</hi>
of things ſenſible (in reſpect whereof the Soul of
it ſelf is like a clear table-Book) may be conveyed
into the Phantaſy, and become at laſt intelligible;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154344:23"/>
Nevertheleſſe ſome <hi>Habits</hi> may be called, and with
great reaſon too <hi>innate,</hi> for as much as the mind by
an <hi>inbred-light</hi> doth immediately give an aſſent to
the thing propounded, without any fear of the <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite</hi>
to it, only the <hi>Apprehenſion of the Terms</hi> being
ſuppoſed; neither to procure its aſſent, doth it want
the helps of internal <hi>ſtudy</hi> or external <hi>inſtitution.</hi>
For example, <hi>The Intellective Habit</hi> of this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Omne totum eſt majus qualibet ſui parte,</hi> Every
thing that is whole is greater then any part of it, is
a <hi>Habit innate</hi> ſo far as by the force of the light of
Nature, and only out of the apprehenſion of the
Terms, the truth thereof of its own accord doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the mind, without any ſtudy or Teacher;
And yet nevertheleſs this <hi>Habit</hi> is acquired, ſo far
as it needeth the aſſiſtance of the ſences, that ſo by
<hi>often actions</hi> in ſenſible things, one may arrive unto
the <hi>knowledge of the Terms,</hi> that is to ſay, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the whole, and what unto the parts.</p>
            <p>XIX. If it may be yet objected that the <hi>Conſcience</hi>
cannot be called an <hi>Innate Habit,</hi> for thoſe things
which are <hi>Innate,</hi> are not capable of errour, neither
can they be defective, and they are the ſame in all,
in whomſoever they are, but the <hi>Conſcience</hi> can erre,
and be evil, neither is it the ſame in all men, I make
anſwer, that it doth indeed follow from this that
the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not a <hi>Habit ſimply innate</hi> (which
no reaſonable man will affirm, for it is repugnant to
Nature, but as partly (as before mentioned) it is
<hi>innate,</hi> ſo alſo it is partly <hi>acquired.</hi> The Soul of
man doth bring with it as it were, ſome ſeeds of
knowledge of <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> which grow up and are
perfected by <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>inſtitution;</hi> In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>natural agility</hi> is compleated by <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154344:23"/>
               <hi>natural Logick,</hi> by <hi>Logick artificial;</hi> the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
therefore in reſpect of thoſe morall <hi>Agibles,</hi>
which as the School-men ſpeak, are of the firſt
<hi>Dictates</hi> of Nature, and are its <hi>primary objects,</hi> is a
natural or an <hi>innate Habit,</hi> and is alike in all men,
and is always <hi>right,</hi> without any <hi>errour</hi> or <hi>depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but in reſpect of thoſe things which are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
learned and come cloſe up unto thoſe firſt
principles, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> whether it be by an <hi>internal</hi>
and <hi>proper meditation,</hi> or an <hi>external inſtitution,</hi> it is
a <hi>Habit</hi> acquired, and may be erronious, and
defective.</p>
            <p>XX. But this is enough, if not too much, of the
<hi>Genus of Conſcience.</hi> I ſhall more briefly diſpatch
the reſt. The ſecond member of the <hi>Definition</hi> is
the <hi>Subject</hi> which is twofold, <hi>viz. Subjectum</hi>

to this diſcourſe to know the nature of <hi>Angelick
minds,</hi> and it hath pleaſed the moſt wiſe God to
make but little mention of it in the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have
appropriated this <hi>Definition of the Conſcience</hi> unto
man only; For although in brutiſh creatures there
appeareth a ſhadow of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as of reaſon, and
many things are performed by them which do bear
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154344:24"/>
a ſhow of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> (as indeed what is
reported of Elephants, and of the policy of <hi>Bees,</hi> and
Dogs, and of ſome other living Creatures is much
to be admired) yet they are all but the works of
the <hi>Phantaſy,</hi> and not of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and they proceed
from a <hi>natural Inſtinct,</hi> and not from <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
Man therefore is the proper <hi>Subject</hi> as well of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
as of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and every man is ſo, the very
Heathens, the Reprobates, and even Infants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
being not excluded. As for the Heathens,
St. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 2. 15. expreſsly ſpeaketh, that they
do ſhow the works of the Law to be written in
their hearts, <hi>their Conſciences bearing them witneſſe;</hi>
And the ſame Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Tit.</hi> 1 15. declareth, that
the filthieſt perſons have a Conſcience although an
impure one, for the <hi>uprightneſſe and integrity</hi> of
Conſcience is loſt by the <hi>Fall,</hi> and not by nature.
And being regenerate and new born, there as no new
Conſcience infuſed, which before was wanting,
but the Conſcience foul before, and impure by ſin,
being ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, is purified
by Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the eternal Counſels of the
Almighty God; And even in young Children (that
the name of God may be magnified in ſucklings)
ſome Sparks do fly from the aſhes of the old fire,
and though but very weakly, there is ſome light of
reaſon to be ſeen, the force of Conſcience ſo early
working in them, that if they have committed any
treſpaſſe, they will modeſtly ſtrive to cover and
conceal it.</p>

the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Soul, in which the Conſcience

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154344:24"/>
               <hi>Speculative Intellect.</hi> There is a great controverſie
amongſt the School-men; whether the Conſcience
doth pertain to the <hi>Intellect,</hi> or the <hi>Will,</hi> or unto
<hi>both.</hi> I will not thruſt my ſelf into theſe contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you have had enough, if not too much already
of the nicetyes and difficulties of the School-men.
I ſhall therefore in few words diſpatch unto you
what I ſhall find expedient for my preſent purpoſe.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his third Book <hi>de anima,</hi> doth number
up three diſtinct <hi>Potentia's</hi> of the part <hi>intellective,</hi>
two whereof are <hi>Cognitive,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Intellect,</hi> and the <hi>practical,</hi> and the third <hi>appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
which is the <hi>Will.</hi> Of theſe three, the <hi>Extreams</hi>
are the <hi>Intellect ſpeculative</hi> which looketh on <hi>Truth</hi>
as <hi>Truth,</hi> and preciſely reſteth in it, without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or reſpect to <hi>practice;</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> and <hi>preciſely</hi> tendeth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
Now amongſt both theſe <hi>Potentia's</hi> the
<hi>practick Intellect</hi> is ſeated in the middle, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Cuſtome of things intermedial, doth in
ſome part concord with either of the <hi>Extreams,</hi>
and in ſome part doth differ from them. The <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Intellect</hi> doth agree with the <hi>Speculative</hi> in this,
that it doth look on <hi>Truth,</hi> and with the <hi>Will</hi> in
this, that it inclineth to operation. As for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
it is moſt certain that it doth not pertain
to the <hi>ſpeculative Intellect,</hi> becauſe it altogether
doth direct its <hi>Science</hi> into <hi>practiſe,</hi> neither doth it
properly pertain unto the <hi>Will,</hi> for if it were ſo, it
would be in it as a <hi>Potentia,</hi> and be the ſame as <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
arbitrium</hi> or <hi>free-will,</hi> or as a <hi>Habit,</hi> and ſo it
would become one of the moral Vertues, neither
of which was ever admitted, or aſſerted by any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
or any Philoſopher. It therefore altogether
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154344:25"/>
belongeth to the <hi>cognitive, practical potentia,</hi> that
is, to the <hi>practical Intellect.</hi> And thus <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
although he had placed the moral virtues in the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
appetitive,</hi> yet he placed the <hi>Habits</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Prudence</hi> (though ordinated to practice) in the
<hi>cognitive power,</hi> as may be ſeen in the fifth book
of his <hi>Ethicks.</hi> This opinion is confirmed by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> theſe Arguments; Firſt, that <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a kind of
<hi>Science,</hi> and all <hi>Science</hi> is in the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that it is capable of <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> is a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Diſeaſe of the <hi>Understanding.</hi> Thirdly, according

them, or not approveth them, is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            </p>
            <p>XXII. We have ſeen the <hi>Genus,</hi> and the <hi>Subject,</hi> the
<hi>Object</hi> followeth, which is <hi>that</hi> about which the
<hi>Conſcience</hi> is verſed, and they are the <hi>particular</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>and proper Moral Acts.</hi> In the firſt place I ſay
<hi>Acts, that is,</hi> ſomething done by a Man, as he is a
Man, or a rational Creature, whether it be for
the future or to be done, or whether it be paſt and
already done, or preſent, and now in doing. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
is compacted of Eyes, it ſeeth, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into all things; It beholdeth things to come, if
you are about to commit any filthyneſſe, it doth
Councel you to forbear it, it beholdeth things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and in the very act of ſinning, it <hi>murmureth,
checketh, biteth, picketh,</hi> it <hi>juſtles,</hi> and <hi>joggs</hi> you to
give off; It looketh back on things paſt, and when
you have ſinned, it <hi>reproveth,</hi> it <hi>ſtingeth,</hi> and <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:154344:25"/>
it <hi>condemneth,</hi> and <hi>tormenteth</hi> you. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, to good deeds it exhorts you, and
whilſt you are a doing of them, it doth <hi>incourage,</hi>
and <hi>excite,</hi> and <hi>provoke</hi> you, and having done them,
it crowns your head with <hi>Honour,</hi> and fills your
breaſt with <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> In the Second place I
ſay <hi>particular Acts;</hi> not by limiting the <hi>Subject,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
as if there were ſome <hi>Acts</hi> that were not <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;</hi>
but oppoſitely to that <hi>Science</hi> which the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
doth ſuppoſe and apply, and although this
<hi>Science</hi> be univerſal, it is yet referred to <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Acts.</hi> In the third place I ſay <hi>particular, proper</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> to exclude that ſignification of <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
which more largely accepted, is extended to the
<hi>Actions</hi> of other Men; as when a man may be ſaid
to be <hi>Conſcious of the Kings ſecrets,</hi> to be <hi>conſcious of
Catilines conſpiracy,</hi> and the like; Such <hi>Actions</hi>
do not belong to our intent in this place, who do
here treat of <hi>Conſcience properly ſo called,</hi> which is
exerciſed in <hi>Agibles,</hi> either performed, or to be
performed by it ſelf. In the fourth place, I ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Moral Acts,</hi> where it is to be obſerved that ſome
things are brought about by <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and ſome
things do fall out by contingency; By <hi>neceſſity,</hi> as the
Riſing of the Sun, the Eclipſe of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of which there is a <hi>Science,</hi> by reaſon of their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
but they have not the leaſt relation either
to <hi>Conſcience</hi> or <hi>Free-Will.</hi> Thoſe things which
caſually come to paſſe, are either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>things
in our own power,</hi> or <hi>things not in our power;</hi> Things
not in our power, as the flying of Birds; a Tempeſt
ſuddainly raiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which come not within the
compaſſe of <hi>Science</hi> by reaſon of their uncertainty,
and being out of our power, they may be as well put
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154344:26"/>
out of our care, the <hi>Will</hi> having nothing to do to
chooſe, nor the Conſcience to determine of them.
Again, things that are in our power, are ſome of
them morally <hi>neutral,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, which
neither of themſelves, nor on the account of any,
permanent circumſtance do contain any moral
<hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil;</hi> as to go into the market, to write a
letter &amp;c. And ſuch things indeed may pertain to
the freedom of the <hi>Will,</hi> if at leaſt they be worthy
to be taken into conſideration, becauſe they may
come under the compaſs of <hi>Choyce,</hi> but of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they do not pertain to the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> I ſay,
of themſelves, for they may pertain unto it by <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,</hi>
by reaſon of ſome Scandal, or any other
circumſtance of which the <hi>Conſcience</hi> may take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance;
Other things there are, which are moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> as to ſerve God, to honour our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
to reſtore the pledge, to oppreſſe the poor,
to plunder, to keep or to break our truſts, and all
other things which the Philoſophers call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, worthy praiſe, or reproof, and
the Schoolmen <hi>meritorious</hi> or <hi>demeritorious.</hi> And
theſe things are properly the objects of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIII. The <hi>object</hi> therefore of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of
man is a <hi>moral operable</hi> that is either done, or to be
done, either omitted or that may be omitted; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
it is to be advertiſed, that in men as they
are Chriſtians, the <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is further
to be extended, and not only oblige them to the
performance of their duties, as they are men, but
to believe the myſteries of Faith revealed in the
word of God, as they are Chriſtians, for <hi>infidelity
doth cauſe the Conſcience to be impure, Tit</hi> 1 15.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154344:26"/>
And the Conſcience doth ſting that man as much,
who diſpiſeth what he vowed in Baptiſm to believe,
as him who violates the commandment which he
promiſed to keep; And it may not unfitly perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
be ſaid that even the <hi>Evangelical Faith it</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>ſelf</hi> is to be accounted amongſt the <hi>moral operables.</hi>
They are the expreſs words of our Saviour, <hi>This is
the work of God that you believe in his Son, Joh.</hi> 6.
29. And the like in the firſt Book of the Apoſtle
St. <hi>John,</hi> the third Chapter, and twenty third verſe.
<hi>This is his Commandment that we believe in the name
of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as he hath commanded us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIIII. The laſt member of the <hi>Definition</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
which is, <hi>The proper act of Conſcience,</hi> to
wit the <hi>application</hi> of the light which is in the mind
by the diſcourſe of <hi>reaſon</hi> to particular <hi>Acts;</hi> I ſay
in the firſt place, that <hi>application</hi> is the proper, and
primary Act of the Conſcience. That <hi>Axiome</hi> in
the Schooles is in every mans mouth; <hi>That of,
one Habit there is but one Act,</hi> to wit, the <hi>primary</hi>
and the <hi>chief,</hi> and unto which all the other <hi>Acts</hi>
pertaining to it, may be reduced; It may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear by what is already ſpoken, that there are
many <hi>Acts</hi> of the Conſcience in the <hi>Species</hi> of it,
but what is that moſt common <hi>Act,</hi> which brings
all the other within its compaſſe, is moſt of all to
be inquired after; for no other <hi>Act</hi> but that <hi>prima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry</hi>
one, which is <hi>adaequate</hi> unto <hi>Habit,</hi> and to which all
other <hi>Acts</hi> are reduced, ought to come into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Habit;</hi> And hereupon it is that many
when they obſerved that moſt of thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
by the Conſcience may in ſome meaſure be
referred to the <hi>Act of judging</hi> (for the <hi>Conſcience</hi>
doth judge of <hi>Acts</hi> paſt, preſent, and to come, they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154344:27"/>
concluded that this <hi>primary Act</hi> was the <hi>Act of
judging.</hi> But there are ſome <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi>
which cannot but hardly and with reſtraint be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to it; As that <hi>Act</hi> (for example) by which
the Conſcience gives teſtimony of ſome thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or omitted; For it is not for a Judge to be
a witneſſe, nor for a witneſſe to paſs judgement on
a Treſpaſſe; Moreover that <hi>Act of judging</hi> doth
neceſſarily preſuppoſe the <hi>Act of applying,</hi> as going
before it, for it cannot be but that the <hi>Conſcience</hi>
muſt firſt apply the Fact, which it is about to judge,
to the light of the mind, before it can give true
judgment on it; And this <hi>Act of application</hi> is very
neer of kine to the derivation of the word, of
which I have before ſpoken, that Conſcience is
ſo called becauſe it is an <hi>application of knowledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXV. In the ſecond place, I ſay, that this <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
is an <hi>application</hi> of the light which is in the
mind, that is of the light preſent to the mind at that
time when the <hi>Application</hi> is made, whether it be
that light of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> common notions written
in the Hearts of men by the dictates of nature, and
kept in the <hi>Syntereſis</hi> or guiltleſſe conſervation
of the mind, as a treaſure ſnatcht from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fire, and the reliques of the Image of God after
the Fall, or whether it be a light of <hi>Divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
either extraordinary by <hi>Viſions, Dreams,</hi> and
<hi>Propheſies,</hi> or ordinary, being laid open to mankind
in the bookes of the old and new Teſtament. Or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether it be the <hi>light of reaſon,</hi> to wit, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
from the principles of both kinds, from the <hi>law
of nature</hi> and the <hi>Divine revelation,</hi> is ſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and evidently deduced, that no man who doth
grant the one can doubt of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:154344:27"/>
XXVI. In the third place I do ſay that this light
is applyed by the diſcourſe of reaſon, for this light
that is to be applyed being <hi>quid univerſale,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
univerſal, and that which it is applyed to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>particular,</hi> or <hi>ſingular Acts,</hi> ſuch an application
cannot be made but by the <hi>mediation</hi> of this <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of reaſon</hi> which is able to unite <hi>Univerſals</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Singulars;</hi> And this is the work of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> by
ſuch a <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi>

I have exhibited unto you. Moreover it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
comes to paſs, (as it is commonly ſpoken, and
experience doth prove it to be true) that we erre
by <hi>going downwards,</hi> and ſo it is, that although we do
not eaſily fall into an errour concerning the <hi>Prima</hi>
&amp; <hi>Univerſalia principia</hi> the univerſal principles which
do carry with them a greater evidence; yet in the
<hi>application</hi> of thoſe <hi>principles,</hi> and in deducing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions</hi>
from them, errours moſt often are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
wherefore we muſt uſe the greater care,<note place="margin">

that we do not deceive our ſelves, but that in

that ſo we may juſtly proceed, and as legitimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and duely conclude.</p>
            <p>XXVII. Fourthly, I ſay that this <hi>application</hi>
ought to be made to <hi>particular Acts,</hi> which four
ways may be done, for the <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth apply the
light of the mind, with which it is endued, either
to things already done, or to things to be done. To
things already done in a twofold conſideration, firſt
by bearing teſtimony that this is done, or that it is
not done by us, in this manner are thoſe formes of
the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> in the queſtion of the <hi>Fact, Creſtes
haſt thou killed thy mother?</hi> the Conſcience maketh
anſwer, <hi>I have killed her;</hi> Secondly by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:154344:28"/>
judgment whether the fact committed or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
be well or ill done, or whether well or
ill omitted; as in the queſtion of <hi>right</hi> or
<hi>Law</hi> (among the <hi>Rhetorici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns</hi>) where the Fact
is evident, as Didſt thou kill <hi>Clodius, Milo?</hi>
the reply is, <hi>I kill'd him.</hi> Doſt thou therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
thy ſelf guilty? <hi>I have killed him lawfully</hi>
Here in the firſt <hi>application</hi> the Conſcience proceeds
by the way of a <hi>witneſſe;</hi> in the ſecond by the way
of a <hi>Judge;</hi> for the <hi>offices,</hi> and <hi>Acts of Conſcience</hi>
in the firſt proceeding are to bear <hi>witneſſe,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to <hi>reprove,</hi> to <hi>accuſe,</hi> to <hi>excuſe,</hi> to <hi>condemn,</hi> to
<hi>abſolve;</hi> From hence there doe ariſe diverſe <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>
in the Soul from the <hi>Conſcience reproving, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing,</hi>
and <hi>condemning;</hi> a great ſadneſſe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of mind, remorſes, terrours, and torments;
and on the other ſide, from the excuſing, defending,
and abſolving Conſcience, there proceeds an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
peace, and tranquility, an unſpeakable joy,
and ſolace, an erected hope, an unſtartling confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and a moſt ſtedfaſt and unſhaken conſtancy
of mind. The third <hi>application</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth
look on things, <hi>future</hi> that are to be done, in which
the <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth proceed as a <hi>Law-giver, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,</hi>
and <hi>Admoniſher</hi> or a <hi>Counſellour:</hi> And in
this manner of proceeding, the <hi>offices</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Conſcience</hi> are to <hi>dictate,</hi> to <hi>oblige,</hi> to <hi>incite,</hi> to <hi>retract:</hi>
theſe are the principle Acts of <hi>Conſcience</hi> to whoſe
voice incouraging to righteouſneſs whoſoever ſhall

Judge.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. I have now finiſhed what I conceived
neceſſary to be ſpoken concerning the nature of
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> in which I have been longer (I fear)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154344:28"/>
but certainly more obſcure then either I would or
ought to be (if the Subject could otherwiſe have
born it,) or then I hope I ſhall be in the following
Lectures concerning the uſe of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> But
truly all <hi>diſputation</hi> concerning the <hi>faculties</hi> and
<hi>Potentia's of the Intellective ſoul,</hi> is intricate and
perplexed, as moſt grave and learned men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
complained of it, both becauſe the things
themſelves are ſomething more remote from <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matter and motion,</hi> as alſo by reaſon of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<hi>relation</hi> and <hi>connexion.</hi> But peradventure you
will ſay unto me, by your <hi>Definition</hi> you have rather
obſcured, then any ways illuſtrated a thing that is
manifeſt, and vulgarly known, which is in the daily
uſe, and in the mouth of all men; truly in this, I
cannot deny the objection, ſo empty are the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and cogitations of men, and ſo weak are all our
endeavours, Thoſe things which are before our
feet, and eyes, which of themſelves do jump into

it, he did proſecute him with continual
plagues, and in the ſame ſence it may be ſaid that
God hath given to every particular man a proper
Conſcience to be as a God unto him, which in Gods
ſteed, as the Preacher of his eternal Law; ſhould
dictate to him what he ought to do, and what to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
and which ſollicitouſly ſhould importune him

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154344:30"/>
and aſſign unto every one either rewards, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
according to their deſerts; for by nature
the ſtate of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is placed as it were in the
middle betwixt both, beneath God, but above Man,
ſubject unto God as a <hi>Hand-maid,</hi> but ſet over man
as a Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>II. From hence it is, that Conſcience is taken into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
a double conſideration, as it cometh to paſs in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which are in an order diſpoſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules of <hi>Sub</hi> and <hi>Supra, Above</hi> or <hi>Under,</hi>
in which thoſe which poſſeſs the middle place have
a two-fold relation, the one to the thing <hi>Superiour,</hi>
under which they are, and the other things to the
<hi>Inferiour</hi> which are placed under them; Thus a
<hi>Captain</hi> obeys his <hi>Lieutenant Colonell,</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the common Souldier. <hi>I am a man placed
under Authority, having Souldiers under me, Math.</hi>
8. 9. And in the <hi>praedicamental courſe and order,</hi>
thoſe things which are placed between the <hi>higheſt
Genus,</hi> and the <hi>loweſt Species,</hi> are both the <hi>Genera</hi> of
thoſe <hi>Species</hi> of which they are predicated, and the
<hi>Species</hi> of thoſe <hi>Genuſſes</hi> to which they are ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the ſame manner <hi>Conſcience</hi> receiveth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Condition, as it hath a relation unto diverſe
things, for it hath the condition of a <hi>power regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
or of a <hi>thing regulated;</hi> In the reſpect of God,
and the Law of God, it hath the condition of a thing
<hi>regulated,</hi> but in reſpect of man, and of humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the condition of a <hi>power regulating.</hi> And ſince
it is our purpoſe to expound unto you <hi>the uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
of which in our laſt Lecture we have given
you the Definition, eſpecially ſo far as it pertaineth
to the performance of things, and is commodious
for the Inſtitution of our life, and manners, the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154344:31"/>
courſe of the Subject, and of our ſtudies doth here
require, that we ſhould now ſpeak of the <hi>double ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Conſcience</hi> that ſhall be uſefull to us, which
is the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>paſſive obligation;</hi> The <hi>paſſive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi>
of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is that by which it is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to confirm it ſelf to the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> to which as
to a Rule it is ſubjected. The <hi>Active obligation</hi> is
that which obligeth all humane Acts to a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereunto, and is as a rule over them; There are
therefore two parts of this preſent treatiſe, the
firſt of the <hi>ſubjection of Conſcience,</hi> or the <hi>paſſive obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi>
The ſecond, of the <hi>power of Conſcience</hi> or the
<hi>active obligation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. Of the firſt of which, that this diſcourſe may
more legitimately proceed, this is firſt to be premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſeeing that the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of every thing conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in its conformity to its <hi>next and immediate Rule,</hi>
and ſo gradually aſcendeth to its <hi>firſt</hi> and moſt <hi>chief
Rule,</hi> and ſeeing the immediate Rule or Law of
Conſcience, is <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> but ſubject to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Law which God hath praeſcribed to it, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
may there be ſaid to be <hi>right</hi> when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to <hi>right Reaſon</hi> according to that Law
which God the ſupreme Law-giver hath praeſcribed
to it, for the condition of that <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Work,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, which at that time we are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>The laſt Explication or reſolution of Conſcience
is into a certain Law impoſed by God on a rational
creature, as being the <hi>Lord of Conſcience</hi> alone, and
the <hi>Supreme Legiſlator,</hi> who indued man with
a Conſcience, and who is the only knower and the
Judge of it, &amp; who alone hath power to ſave or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
a Soul, accodingly as it hath kept or broken his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154344:31"/>
Commandements, <hi>James 5 12. There is but one
Law-giver who can ſave and who can deſtroy.</hi> Which
is ſo confeſſed by all men in whatſoever parts of the
world they live, that there is hardly one to be found
who will not of his own accord allow it to be moſt
true in the <hi>Theſis</hi> or the <hi>Poſition</hi> of it; but in the
<hi>Hypotheſiis</hi> or <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> (when any thing is to be
done,) I know not by what depravedneſs of the heart
it comes to paſs that many men (and even thoſe
men who appear neither to themſelves nor unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to have thrown off all care of Conſcience)
are with ſuch prone affections tranſported to thoſe
things which they deſire to be done, that they do
not only forbear to bring them moſt faithfully to be
examined by that moſt chief and ſupreme rule,
which is onely able to ſecure the Conſcience, but
they conceive it is enough for the ſecurity of their
<hi>Conſciences,</hi> if either by the <hi>pretence of a good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or by the <hi>Example</hi> of ſome holy man, or if by
the <hi>Authority</hi> of ſome great Divine they can any
ways defend themſelves, and what they have acted.
And becauſe this Deceipt in the hearts of men
hath been too prevalent in all ages, and eſpecially in
theſe laſt times, I perſwaded my ſelf that it would
be a work moſt profitable, and moſt neceſſary for
the manners in which we live, if I could expound
thoſe three vulgar <hi>ſuppoſitions,</hi> which are ſo full of
the <hi>trepanne,</hi> and ſo dangerous unto ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
therefore before we do diſcend to ſeek and
find out the true rule of Conſcience, we muſt firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
that there is not any protection enoguh for
the ſecurity of the Conſcience, in the performance
of any affair, if that which is do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e be not performed
only with <hi>a good intention,</hi> or be ſupported by the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154344:32"/>
example of a Godly Man, or by the Judgement of
a Learned one. Of the two laſt (God willing)
we ſhall treat hereafter, our Diſcourſe at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſhall be of that ſubject which in the firſt place
doth incounter us, <hi>viz. Of a good Intention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Where I ſhall lay down this Concluſion,
<hi>That the goodneſſe of the Intention is not enough to
juſtifie the goodneſſe of the Act.</hi> That is, a <hi>good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
cannot alone, and of it ſelf procure that any
humane <hi>Act</hi> ſhould be <hi>morally good,</hi> or, which is
the ſame, and they are the very words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
that <hi>Evil ſhould be done that Good may come
thereby.</hi> When I ſay an <hi>Act,</hi> I underſtand both
the <hi>inward Act,</hi> which is in the <hi>Will,</hi> and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
<hi>Acts</hi> in the <hi>executing faculties,</hi> which are
flowing from it, it being my meaning, that out of
a <hi>good Intention alone</hi> it doth not follow that either
the <hi>Will</hi> it ſelf, which is the firſt principle of acting,
or any externall Act flowing from it ſhould be ſaid
to be <hi>good.</hi> The <hi>Intention</hi> may be taken two wayes;
firſt <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> for the Act of <hi>Intending,</hi>
that is, for the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> tending to the
<hi>end</hi> by ſome certain <hi>mediums.</hi> Secondly, <hi>materially,</hi>
and <hi>objectively,</hi> for the <hi>thing it ſelf intended,</hi> that is,
for the <hi>end</hi> to which the <hi>Will</hi> ſo tendeth. For the
<hi>Act intending,</hi> and the <hi>end intended</hi> are of one and
an alike conſideration to the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> or the <hi>evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
of the <hi>Act,</hi> if we look upon the <hi>quality of the
Act,</hi> but if we ſhall reflect upon the <hi>quantity</hi> of the
<hi>goodneſſe</hi> or of the <hi>evilneſſe</hi> of it, there will be
found ſome diſproportion in the conſideration
thereof. For it being granted that ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Act</hi> is <hi>good</hi>
in its own <hi>Species,</hi> and upon the account of its <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
and that it may be done for a <hi>good end,</hi> or on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154344:32"/>
the contrary it being granted that the <hi>Act</hi> is <hi>evil,</hi> and
is done to an <hi>evil end;</hi> by how much the ſtronger the
<hi>Will</hi> is moved whiles it tendeth to that end, by ſo
much the <hi>Act</hi> reſpectively, will either be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or the worſe; As if a man ſhould partake of the
<hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> to that <hi>end,</hi> to put himſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the death of Chriſt; the more entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he applyes the mind to the remembrance of
his death, the better he performes the duty of a
true Communicant. Again, if a man ſhould ſlander his
neighbour, intending the ruine of him, by how much
the more violently he intends it, by ſo much the
worſe is his <hi>Act</hi> of Calumnation, <hi>The quantity
therefore of a good or an evil Act is correſpondent to
the quantity of the goodneſſe or the evilneſſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>
and is <hi>commenſurate with it,</hi> if the <hi>Intention</hi>
be underſtood according to the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>intending,</hi>
and not as to the thing <hi>intended.</hi> But the <hi>intention</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
either way doth not ſuffice to prove this, that
any <hi>Act</hi> which otherwiſe is <hi>evil,</hi> ſhould be made
<hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. This concluſion is proved by many and moſt
ſtrong arguments, firſt by the words of the ſacred
Text, in the third Chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> where the
Apoſtle not without indignation doth deteſt that
grievous ſlander by which it was ſaid to be taught;
<hi>That evil may be done that good ſhould come thereof.</hi>
That the ſence, the ſcope, and the force of this place,
may be the better underſtood, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt
all the Apoſtles was abundantly the moſt copious in
aſſerting every where, the <hi>mercy of God by Grace,</hi>
making <hi>a Covenant of grace</hi> with ſinfull men, and
faithfully fulfilling the Evangellical promiſes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all that <hi>unrighteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>unbelief</hi> of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154344:33"/>
men, which lyeth within their hearts, and openly
and abundantly doth declare it ſelf in their dayly
lives, and converſations, which he profeſſeth to be
ſo far from making theſe <hi>promiſes of God by Grace</hi> to
be in vain, that on the contrary they do render the
glory of his grace and truth to be far more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note>
for <hi>where that the offence abounded, there it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that Grace ſuperabounded.</hi> From hence the
<hi>Sophisters</hi> and <hi>Impoſters</hi> took on one ſide to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
an advantage to ſlander, and to diminiſh if
they could the authority of the Apoſtle. On the
other ſide the Hypocrites and profane did take an
occaſion to live more licentiouſly, and to ſin more
ſecurely; For if that be true (ſaid they) which is
preached by <hi>Paul,</hi> that the ſins of men do redound
to the greater glory of God, there is no reaſon that
God ſhould puniſh ſins, or be angry with ſinners;
There is no reaſon that a man or woman ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from ſinning, nay they ſhould ſin more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
that God might receive the more abundant
glory, and <hi>evil things are altogether to be done, that
good things may come thereby.</hi> The other objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Apoſtle confuteth, but to this, <hi>let us do evil
that good may come of it,</hi> he doth not vouchſafe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
anſwer at all; he only cryeth out, that it is a
manifeſt ſlander, and near of kin unto blaſphemy,
and unleſs they repent, the juſt judgment of God is
threatened to ſuch importunate ſlanderers, as if
this Sophiſm was of that kind of arguments which
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adjudged not to deſerve an anſwer, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a reproof;. It is hence manifeſt, and all Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
do acknowledge it, that the Apoſtle moſt
conſtantly denyeth that any <hi>evil ought to be done for
any intention be it never ſo good.</hi> It much availeth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154344:33"/>
(ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine) to conſider what,</hi>

by reaſon of its own nature, <hi>qua tale,</hi> as it is of ſuch
a nature, for there is nothing <hi>eligible</hi> which is not

under the account of <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is <hi>evil</hi> of its own nature <hi>ordinable</hi> to any

to the <hi>end</hi> propounded by the <hi>Agent,</hi> but to
thoſe things alſo which ſeem to conduce for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of that end. If you object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>God doth dispoſe
of our evils into a good end</hi> of his own, and therefore
it is not againſt the nature of evil to be ordinated to
a <hi>good end.</hi> I anſwer in the firſt place, that the ways <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of Almighty God who is the <hi>Lord of Nature,</hi> and
according to his good pleaſure can produce <hi>good</hi>
out of <hi>evil</hi> are farre different from ours, who have
not the ſame right or the ſame power; neither is
it for us either too curiouſly to enquire, or too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially
to pronounce any thing of the <hi>Providence
of God</hi> concerning evil. In the ſecond place I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that God indeed is able and accuſtomed to
make uſe of our ſins to ſerve his <hi>Glory, Grace</hi> and
<hi>Providence,</hi> and that it is lawfull for us alſo, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
ſhall ſerve, to follow his example and to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154344:34"/>
make <hi>uſe of the ſins of other men</hi> for our <hi>ſpirituall</hi> or
<hi>temporall advantage;</hi> Notwithſtanding, as God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he maketh uſe of the <hi>evil of others,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
<hi>Good</hi> out of it, yet he never doth <hi>evil</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that from thence he might abſtract <hi>good;</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it lawfull for us to do <hi>evil,</hi> that <hi>good</hi> might
proceed from it; It is one thing to make uſe of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>evil</hi> of others, and turn it into <hi>good,</hi> and another
thing to do <hi>evil</hi> with an <hi>intent</hi> of good. Thirdly, I
anſwer, a thing may be ſaid to be <hi>ordinated</hi> in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
reſpect; either <hi>improperly,</hi> in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as a thing which way ſoever it is made uſe of
by the <hi>Agent,</hi> doth notwithſtanding tend to its <hi>end,</hi>
being ſo done by the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premer
Agent,</hi> contrary to the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> of
him that did it, or it is taken more reſtrictly, and
properly, and ſo that only is ſaid to be <hi>ordinated to
its end,</hi> which <hi>antecedently</hi> is choſen by the <hi>Agent</hi> as
a <hi>medium</hi> that by the nature of it is convenient, and
conducible to ſuch an <hi>end.</hi> In the firſt ſence, that
is to be underſtood, when we ſay that God doth <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>
and diſpoſe of <hi>evil</hi> to a <hi>good end,</hi> that is, when
God,<note place="margin">Non co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But we muſt above all things take heed, that theſe

or <hi>make choice</hi> of any evil, as a <hi>medium</hi> convenient
by the nature of it to the aſſecution of any <hi>good
end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. Moreover it is oppoſite to the nature of
<hi>ſin</hi> to produce of it ſelf any <hi>good effect,</hi> as <hi>an evil tree
cannot bring forth good fruit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat 7. 18.</note> nor darkneſſe produce

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:154344:34"/>
God who out of his omnipotence, brought forth <hi>light

to illuſtrate his infinite <hi>wiſdome,</hi> his <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and his <hi>goodneſſe;</hi> But theſe are the effects
of a <hi>divine power,</hi> as of a <hi>cauſe</hi> working properly, and
of it ſelf, to the production whereof there needs no
aſſiſtance, nor ſtrength from our <hi>ſins,</hi> which as to
thoſe effects are but meerly <hi>contingent,</hi> and but by
<hi>accident.</hi> Thoſe words therefore of <hi>David Pſalm</hi>

               </gap> and ſome other Greek particles of the ſame

can inferr a true concluſion from the falſe praemiſes
which before were granted by another, and yet the
ſame Diſputant would ſhow himſelf ridiculous, if
to prove a <hi>true concluſion,</hi> ſhould willingly make
uſe of ſome ſalſe aſſumptions, for <hi>Truth doth not
ſtand in need of the patronage of Falſhood;</hi> ſo Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God (and we alſo in ſome reſpect may do the
like) can diſpoſe of things that are <hi>ill</hi> done into
<hi>good,</hi> but it is neither congruous to the divine Juſtice
and Goodneſs, neither is it any ways lawfull for us
to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>do evil</hi> that <hi>good</hi> may come thereby.</p>
            <p>IX. The <hi>third argument</hi> is taken <hi>a naturâ boni
Actus, from the nature of a good Act,</hi> to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154344:35"/>
whereof the <hi>concurſe</hi> of all requiſite <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
is ſo neceſſary, that if one be but abſent amongſt
ſo many of them, although all the other be preſent,
and ſubſervient, yet that <hi>Act</hi> ſhall not be <hi>morally
good.</hi> Moſt remarkable is that <hi>Axiom, Bonum ex
cauſa integra, malum ex quolibet defectu, Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from an upright and an entire cauſe, but evil
from any defect.</hi> And it is beſides manifeſt in all kind
of things that there are more required to <hi>raiſe up,</hi>
than to throw down; or to deſtroy. <hi>The defect of a
good Intention</hi> is enough to prove any <hi>Action evil</hi>
(for that, the <hi>end whereof is evil,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be
<hi>evil it ſelf</hi>) but it is not enough, it is not ſufficient
that a <hi>good end,</hi> or a <hi>good Intention</hi> ſhould prove the
Action good, unleſs all the other requiſite conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be conjoyned; Now that any <hi>Action</hi> whether
the <hi>internall</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> or the <hi>externall</hi> of the <hi>work,</hi>
may approve themſelves to be good, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that there are three diſtinct <hi>goodneſſes, viz.</hi>
the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>object,</hi> the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of the <hi>end,</hi>
and the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>circumſtances.</hi> The quality
of every Act doth <hi>firſt</hi> of all, and <hi>principally</hi> depend
on the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>object,</hi> or of the <hi>matter,</hi> about
which it is converſant, ſo that from thence every
<hi>Act</hi> may <hi>indefinitely</hi> and according to the whole <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of it be denominated, either <hi>good or evil;</hi> in this
reſpect we affirm that <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> are <hi>evil</hi> in
the whole <hi>Species</hi> of them, and that <hi>Prayer</hi> and the
<hi>giving of Alms</hi> are <hi>good</hi> in all their ſeverall <hi>reſpects,</hi>
and the acceptations of them; but with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that things which in themſelves are <hi>ſimply evil,</hi>
are ſo <hi>evil,</hi> that neither upon the account of the <hi>end</hi>
although good, nor yet on the account of their <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi>
although never ſo promiſing, they can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154344:35"/>
be made truly <hi>good;</hi> But things which are good
in their own nature, may yet be ſo corrupted by the
<hi>end,</hi> or by <hi>undue circumſtances,</hi> that they may leave
off to be <hi>good,</hi> and become <hi>evil;</hi> The <hi>pravity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the <hi>object</hi> being preſuppoſed we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to abſtain from the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Theft</hi> or of <hi>adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
as being <hi>ſimply evil</hi> in themſelves; But the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the object</hi> being preſuppoſed it is not ſafe for
any one, at the firſt, either to undertake to do it, or
to approve it being done, unleſs he hath diligently
weighed before hand the <hi>end,</hi> to which it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the ſeverall <hi>circumſtances</hi> with which it is
attended, and cloathed: In theſe things therefore
in which it is ſaid that the <hi>Goodneſs of the Act doth
depend on the end, and that the end doth diſcriminate
and crown the actions,</hi> they may be ſaid ſo for to be
true, if the Acts be <hi>good</hi> in conſideration to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
or the <hi>matter,</hi> or at the laſt, if they be of a <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
nature</hi> and <hi>indifferent,</hi> but not if they are <hi>evil.</hi>
For the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>object</hi> being ſuppoſed the
Act doth chiefly take its <hi>goodneſs</hi> or its <hi>evilneſſe</hi>
from the <hi>end.</hi> For examples ſake, the <hi>Act</hi> of giving
a poor man an <hi>alms</hi> though it be a good <hi>Act</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the <hi>matter</hi> or the <hi>object,</hi> yet if it be done
for <hi>vain-glory</hi> it is morally an <hi>evil Act,</hi> becauſe it is
not ordinated to a <hi>good end.</hi> The ſame <hi>Act,</hi> if it be
to relieve the neceſſities of a neighbour is an Act ſo
far good, that it hath a lawfull <hi>matter,</hi> and a <hi>right
Intention</hi> and ſo partaketh of both the <hi>goodneſſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mentioned, to wit, of the <hi>object</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi>
but it cannot yet be affirmed to be <hi>ſimply good,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be moreover <hi>duely circumſtanced,</hi> for to this
complement of a <hi>good work,</hi> beſides that <hi>goodneſs</hi> of
the <hi>object</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> there is required the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154344:36"/>
of circumſtances;</hi> And from hence it is, that
commonly it is ſpoken that <hi>the goodneſſe of the Act
doth depend upon its circumſtances</hi> not <hi>primarily, and
principally,</hi> but <hi>ultimately,</hi> and for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>object</hi> and the <hi>end</hi>
being firſt laid down, ſeeing therefore theſe three
things are required to the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of every <hi>moral
Act,</hi> and they are all to be conjoyned, to wit, the
<hi>matter</hi> lawfull, the <hi>intention</hi> right, and the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi>
due, it is moſt manifeſt that a <hi>right intention</hi>
cannot alone ſuffice by it ſelf, and by conſequent,
that nothing can be performed out of a <hi>good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
whatſoever the <hi>Intention</hi> be, that is either
unlawfull in the <hi>object</hi> or defective in the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>X. But ſome there are who peradventure will
object unto this, thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.
6. 22. If thy eye be ſingle thy whole body ſhall be full
of light, but if thy eye be evil thy whole body ſhall be
full of darkneſs.</hi> Where if the <hi>intention</hi> be undeſſtood
by the <hi>eye</hi> which is the judgment of almoſt all the
Interpreters upon it, it ſeemeth that the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of
the <hi>Act</hi> doth altogether depend on the <hi>goodneſs of
the Intention,</hi> &amp; that adaequately, ſo that what power
an <hi>evil intention</hi> hath to corrupt an <hi>Act</hi> although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<hi>good,</hi> the ſame power a <hi>good intention</hi> hath
to approve and to render an <hi>Act good,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is <hi>evil,</hi> for a <hi>good</hi> or a ſingle eye is as efficati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to <hi>inlighten</hi> the whole body, as an evil eye is to
infuſe darkneſs on it; To adde more ſtrength to this
opinion much may be alledged from the <hi>Fathers</hi> and
other <hi>Divines,</hi> of this nature is that in the <hi>Gloſſe;
As much good as you do intend, ſo much you do perform;</hi>

            <p>XI. But in the way of anſwer, as to that place in
the 6 of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> I am not ignorant in the firſt
place, that ſome learned men of this age do give an
interpretation to it far different from that of
the antient Fathers, and not conſonant to that
we have now in hand; But in reverence to thoſe
antient Doctors, be it granted that thoſe words of
our Saviour had a proper relation to the <hi>Intentions</hi>
of men; I make anſwer, that the <hi>intention</hi> (when it
is a motion of the <hi>Will</hi> tending to ſome <hi>ends</hi> by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>mediums</hi>) is taken into a twofold conſideration,
firſt whether it be for the <hi>intention of that good</hi> into
which the <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>finally</hi> and <hi>preciſely</hi> carryed, being
taken from all conſideration of the <hi>mediums</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it; As if a man ſhould ſay he intends <hi>the
glory of God,</hi> or his own <hi>profit,</hi> and <hi>pleaſure:</hi> or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
whether it be for <hi>an entire ordination of the
whole progreſſe of the work,</hi> from the beginning of
the work unto the end, including alſo the <hi>mediums</hi>
or the <hi>means</hi> to attain it; As if a man ſhould ſay
that he intends the <hi>glory of God</hi> by building a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or ſtaining an Idolater, or that he intends his
<hi>own profit,</hi> by getting riches by his honeſt labour, or
by theft, and plunder, And as he may be ſaid, that
he intends a journey to <hi>Rome</hi> who only thinks of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither, and hath not yet reſolved with himſelf
which way, or upon what accounts he will go, as
well as he who hath reſolved with himſelf, <hi>when</hi> to
go, <hi>which way,</hi> and upon what occaſions. We ſpeak
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154344:37"/>
in this whole diſcourſe of the <hi>Intention</hi> taken the
<hi>firſt way, viz.</hi> on the <hi>intention</hi> which looks altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the <hi>end,</hi> and not on the <hi>means,</hi> &amp; which is
ſo taken in the common uſe of ſpeaking; but thoſe
words of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and other <hi>Divines</hi> which ſeem
by the <hi>intention</hi> alone to meaſure the <hi>goodneſs</hi> or the
<hi>badneſſe</hi> of mens actions, and which are grounded
on thoſe words of our Saviour, in relation to a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
eye,</hi> and to an <hi>eye</hi> that is evil, do receive their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
in the <hi>latter ſignification,</hi> as they include the
<hi>means</hi> with the <hi>end;</hi> obſervable is that of St <hi>Bernard,
That the eye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be ſingle, two things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi>
viz. <hi>that truth be in the election, and Charity
in the intention.</hi> That is, that our intention be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

propound unto our ſelves ſuch an <hi>end</hi> which is averſe
unto the love of God, and of our neighbour, and that
we make not choice of any <hi>means</hi> that are not joyned
with honeſty &amp; righteouſneſs. In every work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt not only look to propound unto our
ſelves a <hi>good end,</hi> but we muſt withall endeavour to
the <hi>end</hi> ſo propounded by <hi>apt,</hi> lawful, &amp; honeſt <hi>means,</hi>

do corrupt thoſe <hi>Actions,</hi> to which they
are retayners.</p>
            <p>XII. The fourth argument is taken from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and obligation of the Law of God; For there
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154344:37"/>
is <hi>a Law</hi> propounded from God to men, a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Law, which commandeth things to be done, and
forbiddeth thoſe things which are not to be done; <hi>It
hath ſhewed unto thee O man what is good, &amp; what the
Lord requireth of thee Mich.</hi> 6. 8. This is the Law
which we muſt obey if we will fulfil our duties, by
this <hi>Law</hi> we are commanded (as the Scriptures eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where do declare) to do <hi>good,</hi> and to eſchew <hi>evil;</hi>
But if we on the contrary, without the leaſt regard to
the <hi>law of God,</hi> ſhall meaſure out unto our ſelves
things to be avoyded or performed, according to our
own profit, and as we ſhall think good, and ſhall
either omit thoſe <hi>good things</hi> which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
to be done for the fear of ſome following
<hi>evil,</hi> or ſhall commit thoſe <hi>evil</hi> things which God
forbiddeth, for the vain hope of ſome good to come,
what is this but (worms as we are) to preferre
our own <hi>Counſels</hi> above the expreſſe <hi>will</hi> of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, and the wiſdome of the fleſh above the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the moſt holy Spirit.</hi> Farre otherwiſe did
that holy man <hi>David, By thy precepts</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>have I gotten underſtanding, therefore have I hated all
unjuſt wayes, Pſal.</hi> 119. 104. As if he ſhould ſay,
being inſtructed by <hi>thy Law</hi> which both night and
day is in my heart, my mouth, &amp; before mine eyes,
I do plainly underſtand what I have to do, and what
I have to eſchew, wherefore I do not only decline
but hate every way which is not conſentaneous to
<hi>thy Law,</hi> whither ſoever it may ſeem to lead me.
Therefore ſince every ſin is forbidden by the <hi>Law</hi>
of God, and that <hi>Law</hi> of his containeth not the
leaſt exception of any good <hi>Intention,</hi> or <hi>Event,</hi> and
we ought not to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> where the <hi>Law maketh
no diſtinction,</hi> nor to <hi>except where the Law maketh
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154344:38"/>
no exception</hi> it is moſt manifeſt, that he whoſoever
he is who for what <hi>Intention,</hi> or what <hi>cauſe</hi> ſoever it
be, doth knowingly and willingly do that which is
evil, he doth ſin againſt the Law of God.</p>
            <p>XIII. The fifth argument followeth, drawn from
the examples of thoſe who under the pretence of a
<hi>good end</hi> being ſo bold as to diſobey the expreſs
Commandment of God, have ſatisfied his anger by
the juſt puniſhment of their raſhneſs, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> being ſent to <hi>Saul</hi> the
King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſaved ſome of the cattle of the
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> which God had commanded ſhould be
totally deſtroyed, for no other end, as he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than by the bulk and fatneſs of his ſacrifice to
make it the more acceptable, the ſaid Prophet did
lay before his eyes the grievouſneſs of his ſin, and
for the puniſhment of ſo great a diſobedience, did
propheſy unto him that his Kingdom ſhould be
taken from him; If any man ſhall think this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not congruous to prove this <hi>truth,</hi> becauſe it doth
not appear that <hi>Saul</hi> did this with any <hi>good intention,</hi>
neither was the <hi>end</hi> which afterwards he pretended,
fixed and grounded in his reſolution when he did
it, but it is more likely that he looked after his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
advantage and commodity, both becauſe it was
objected to him by the Prophet, and laid unto his
charge that he obeyed not the commandment of
God, and becauſe (which is common with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits)
he did make an excuſe for his diſobedience;
That this exception may be waved, &amp; create no more
trouble or ſcruple, it is to be obſerved, that where
<hi>Hypocriſy</hi> is joyned to <hi>diſobedience,</hi> the crime is not
ſo much increaſed, as it is <hi>doubled.</hi> There is no
man doubteth but that <hi>Saul</hi> was guilty of a double
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154344:38"/>
fault, of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> not to make
mention of the third crime which was the root of the
two former, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>mundane affection,</hi> and a deſire of
gain, and of his <hi>own glory.</hi> The ſins of <hi>diſobedience</hi>
and of <hi>diſſimulation</hi> were diſtinct in <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; neither
conjoyned by <hi>nature</hi> or by <hi>time;</hi> not by <hi>nature,</hi> for one
of them can be in any man, without the other; nor
by <hi>time,</hi> for <hi>diſobedience</hi> had the precedency, to w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi>
afterwards upon another occaſion was added <hi>Dſſii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,</hi>
which not obſcurely may be collected
from the very words of <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no mention of the <hi>diſſimulation</hi> of the King, did
only ſharply and ſecurely reprehend him for his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;</hi>
obedience ſaith he is more acceptable
than ſacrifice, as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>What do
you tell me of ſacrifices,</hi> which if you did in earneſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>intend</hi> them, or now to excuſe your <hi>diſobedience</hi>
you do pretend them, it is all one in relation to your
duty. You ought to have obeyed the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and without the leaſt murmuring or
diſpute to have fullfilled that which he preſcribed:
But whatſoever this miſcarriage of <hi>Saul</hi> was, moſt
certain it is, that <hi>Uzzah,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory is written
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. did put forth his hand to the holy Ark
not deceitfully, but devoutly, and with a moſt pious
<hi>Intention,</hi> that the <hi>Ark of the Covenant</hi> ſhould not
fall on the ground (which at that time under the

Symbol of the <hi>Divine preſence</hi>) when the Cart in
which it was carryed being violently ſhaken, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
even ready to ſlip down out of it; By this ſlight
(as ſome have thought) but importunate temerity,
although he had not the leaſt <hi>ill intent,</hi> yet he meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(a multitude of people beholding it) that he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:154344:39"/>
ſhould ſuffer the puniſhment of a ſudden death, w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi>
God then did inflict upon him.<note place="margin">Num. 7. 9.</note> Indeed the Lord
Jehovah had before declared that the <hi>Ark of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
ſhould not be carryed in a <hi>Cart,</hi> but on the
ſhoulders of the Prieſts, neither was it lawful for any,
who was not of the <hi>order of the Prieſthood,</hi> &amp; of the
Family of the <hi>Koathites</hi> to carry the Ark, or to touch
that <hi>ſacred veſſel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 4. 15.</note> he that ſhould preſume to do it
was to periſh by an evil death; Therefore by this
ſevere puniſhment on the firſt violator of that Law,
God did ſtrike into the hearts of men a <hi>reverence</hi>
to the more ſtrict obſervation of the Law,
and preſerved its <hi>Authority,</hi> that no man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any pretence whatſoever ſhould boldly preſume
to do or to attempt againſt that which he had <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
And the anger of the Lord was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>
Uzzah, <hi>and God ſmote him there for his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

<hi>which is, that the reſtraint of the Law being

certainly not unprofitable to you, to derive ſome

therefore in the firſt place, from that which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſpoken, that all pious men muſt take heed, leaſt
being tranſported by a <hi>zeal to the</hi> glory of God, they
be carryed away to unlawfull <hi>Acts.</hi> There is no true

that the <hi>glory of God</hi> in the reſpect of ſingular

Now it is manifeſt that to a <hi>Tranſcendent</hi> no <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi>

Now as nothing hath truly the condition of an <hi>Ens</hi>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154344:42"/>
hence it is that the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> of old, were indued

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154344:43"/>

it be a ſin, which caſe is different from our preſent
inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XVIII. If you demand, is it lawfull for</hi> Caius
<hi>to admit unto himſelf a leſs ſin to hinder a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
one, which</hi> Titius <hi>otherwiſe would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
as to be guilty of ſome</hi> petty larceny, <hi>that
the other might not commit a murder. I ſay with
St.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>that it is not lawfull, his words are
theſe,</hi> Si quaeratur quid duorum potius debuit evitare
qui utrum<expan>
                  <am>
                     <g ref="char:abque"/>
                  </am>
                  <ex>que</ex>
               </expan> non potuit, ſed alterutrum potuit, respondeo
ſuum peccatum potius quam alienum, &amp; levius potiùs
quod ſuum, quàm gravius quod alienum. If it be
demanded of me (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) what of the two he ought
rather to avoid, who cannot eſchew both ſins, but may
one of them. I anſwer his own ſin rather than anothers,
and more eaſily his own than anothers. The reaſon is
ready, for it is in my power that I do not ſin, but not if
another ſinneth. <hi>And thus he proceeds,</hi> Ego utrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <expan>
                  <am>
                     <g ref="char:abque"/>
                  </am>
                  <ex>que</ex>
               </expan>
malum fieri nollem, ſed id tantum cavere potui, ne
fieret quod erat in mea potestate. I would have neither
of the two evils committed, but I could only be cautious
in this, that the evill ſhould not be committed which
was in my power. <hi>But</hi> man-ſlaughter <hi>is a greater
crime then</hi> theft, <hi>St.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>doth confeſſe it,
and makes anſwer that</hi> nevertheleſs it is worſe to act
a theft, then to ſuffer a man-ſlaughter; <hi>And to the
ſame purpoſe he expreſſeth himſelf in another place,</hi>
Quantumlibet diſtet inter tuum &amp; aliennm, hoc ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
erit tuum illud alienum. <hi>Let the crime be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo rightly ſtated, yet</hi> this <hi>ſhall be</hi> thy own, <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:154344:43"/>
that <hi>ſhall be another mans. This is cleer, and I
need no longer to inſiſt upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIX. In the fifth place, if it be yet demanded,
is it lawfull at leaſt for any man to perſwade a leſs
<hi>evil</hi> to him who is ready to commit a <hi>greater,</hi> as if
a man be ready to cut the throat of his enemy, to
perſwade him to inflict only ſome ſlight wound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. The ſpeech of <hi>Lot</hi> to his fellow Citizens
tendeth to this purpoſe; And there are many who
differ in their judgment concerning it. I do not
much wonder that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth excuſe it, for
it is the inclination of his <hi>Genius</hi> and in the ſame
manner he excuſeth all the infirmities of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches.
Ambroſe</hi> doth excuſe him alſo, and ſo do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, eſpecially the <hi>Antients.</hi> But St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
doth cenſure him as guilty of ſin, and his
judgment hath been approved of by many who
ſince have followed him; and undoubtedly it doth
appear, that this holy man out of a pious affection
to his Gueſts, being extreamly ſollicitous, that no
force or inj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry ſhould be offered to them, did
ſome things, and peradventure ſpoke more out of
the diſtemper of a troubled mind, than might eaſily
be excuſed. Therefore to paſſe over this fact of <hi>Lot,</hi>
we will return from the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to the <hi>Theſis,</hi> or
to the queſtion now in hand; I do conceive that it
is lawfull for a man to perſwade a leſs evil unto his
friend to avoid the commiſſion of a greater. If perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
you ſhall alledge, whoſoever <hi>perſwades a ſin</hi>
unto another, although it be but a little one, doth
nevertheleſſe <hi>perſwade</hi> him to a <hi>ſin,</hi> which whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doth do, he in that very <hi>Act</hi> doth make himſelf
guilty of <hi>another mans ſin.</hi> I make anſwer, that it
is one thing <hi>abſolutely</hi> to perſwade a man to <hi>this</hi> or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154344:44"/>
               <hi>that ſin,</hi> which whoſoever doth, he doth undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>ſin,</hi> and another thing to perſwade him to a <hi>ſin
conditionally,</hi> and upon that ſuppoſition that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
otherwiſe eſchew a greater <hi>ſin,</hi> which being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and granted, he is not ſo much to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to have induced by his Counſel another to a <hi>leſs
ſin,</hi> as to have diverted him from a <hi>greater and a
more crying one,</hi> for he did not <hi>perſwade</hi> him to <hi>ſin</hi>
as it was <hi>ſin,</hi> but as it was a leſs <hi>ſin,</hi> and the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
of a <hi>greater one.</hi> If you ſhall again object;
If it be lawfull for me to perſwade another man
to make choyce of a <hi>leſs ſin,</hi> why is it not lawfull
for that man of his own accord to <hi>make choice</hi> of
that ſin, I not perſwading him to it, nay, why may
I not do that <hi>ſafely</hi> my ſelf, which <hi>lawfully</hi> I do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
unto another, and that is <hi>of two ſins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to make choice of the leſs.</hi> Or of the <hi>three</hi> ways
here ſpoken of, why is the firſt only thought to be
lawfull, and neither of the <hi>two others,</hi> the manner
and the account of all the <hi>three</hi> appearing to be the
ſame. I make anſwer, and do conſtantly deny the
condition and the reaſon of them to be the ſame,
the difference being moſt manifeſt, that it is not
lawfull for <hi>him</hi> on <hi>his accord,</hi> nor for <hi>me</hi> on <hi>my own
accord</hi> to chooſe a leſs ſin to avoid a greater, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it being in both our powers (<hi>respectively</hi>) to
<hi>forbear both,</hi> we are both obliged to make choice of
neither, but that it is lawfull for me to perſwade
unto another, a <hi>leſs ſin</hi> that a greater may be abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
doth proceed from this, that it is not in the
power of <hi>me the perſwader,</hi> (for that is already ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
to hinder or to ſtop the courſe of <hi>either of
them;</hi> I muſt do my endeavour indeed, as much as
lies in the <hi>power</hi> of my perſwaſions, to give a ſtop
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154344:44"/>
unto <hi>them both,</hi> but when I find that I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that, which above all I <hi>would,</hi> and have a deſire
to do, I do at the leaſt perform that which I am <hi>able,</hi>
and which I ought to do, to perſwade to a <hi>leſs ſin</hi>
to hinder the commiſſion of a <hi>greater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XX. By theſe things hitherto diſcourſed of it
is eaſy to be underſtood, what is the ſence of that
Proverb, <hi>E malis minimum, Of evils the leaſt,</hi> and
what is the uſe of it in all humane conſideration,
whether it be applyed to the <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>puniſhment</hi> or
to the <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>fault,</hi> for (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay down the ſtate of the queſtions) it holds and
that univerſally alſo, and in both the <hi>kind of evils,</hi> as
often as things do come ſo to paſs when it lyes in
our power, to eſchew one of the two evils if
not to avoid them both. Indeed every <hi>evil</hi> as it is
an <hi>evil</hi> is to be eſchewed by a pious and a prudent
man as much as lyes in his power, therefore two
kind of <hi>evils,</hi> of what kind ſoever, being propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he ought to avoid <hi>both, if poſſible,</hi> if not he may
give ear to his admoniſher, and chooſe that which
is the leaſt; Nevertheleſſe it doth not follow that
although he may chooſe the leaſt of two <hi>evils,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>evil</hi> of the <hi>fault,</hi> or the <hi>evill</hi> of <hi>puniſhment,</hi>
that he may chooſe the leaſt of two ſins, for in ſins
both of them may be avoided as is already above
demonſtrated; And thus much concerning the
ſecond corallary.</p>
            <p>Out of this principal <hi>concluſion,</hi> it followeth in the
third place, that they are in no leſſe, if not a greater
errour who conceive, that <hi>ſin</hi> may drive out <hi>ſin,</hi> as
one nayl doth drive out another, as for example,
<hi>Superſtition</hi> is to be driven out by <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and
<hi>Tyranny</hi> by <hi>Sedition</hi> &amp;c. And this commonly is the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154344:45"/>
error of thoſe men who think themſelvs to be then
moſt wiſe, when like Gardiners, when their plants
and twigs being crooked, &amp; ſtooping too much on
the one ſide, they bend them ſo much on the other
ſide, to make them ſtraight, that they quite do break
them off, and by taking too much care to avoid
one extreme, they improvidently do fall into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,

               </gap>ly couſenages
be adminiſtred, and the lawes of God and men be
violated, were it not better to ſuffer for a little
time that ſuch things ſhould be done, than that the
Common-wealth ſhould be ſick and periſh? I do
read indeed in the Holy Writ that <hi>Chaiphas</hi> the
high Prieſt of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was of that opinion, who
in the Senate of his Nation, all the reſpects to <hi>Law</hi>
and <hi>Juſtice</hi> being laid aſide,<note place="margin">John 11. 50.</note> pronounced that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
though guilty of no crime, was to be put to death,
becauſe it was expedient; I do remember I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
have read that one of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>
being preſent at a great debate in the conclave of
the Cardinals, when it was told him by one of them
that the counſel which was then propounded did
not appear to be juſt unto him, he made anſwer, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may not be done by the way of juſtice yet it
muſt be done by the way of expediency.</hi> This you ſee
what is the only way to be wiſe; This is the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of thoſe men whom they call <hi>Polititians</hi> taken
(as I believe) from the counſels of the Jeſuits, <hi>to
meaſure all things by the profits of the holy mother the
Church,</hi> to write the word of God himſelf as they
pleaſe, and <hi>this way</hi> and <hi>that way</hi> to bend it like a
noſe of wax, and to inforce it to an interpretation
for their own profit, according to their own ſence;
And as that <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> ſaid, <hi>that all things at
Sparta were honeſt which were profitable,</hi> theſe ſparks
of Sparta think nothing is filthy enough, nothing is
to be avoided that may be ſubſervie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 23.</note> before they were fully ſatisfied in
that other queſtion, <hi>is it lawfull or not?</hi> Nay the more

judgment, who as often as <hi>Honeſty</hi> did ſeem to
diſagree with profit, they ſo always have made the

ſame is not profitable which is not alſo honeſt.</p>
            <p>XXIII. But to make no long digreſſion, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in this verſe doth altogether deny, that <hi>any evil is
to be done that good may come thereby,</hi> than which
words what can be ſpoken more plainly, or effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to prove our concluſion; But not long ſince
I heard with theſe ears when thoſe words of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi>
were urged, and ſome then preſent could
not otherwiſe defend what they ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to maintain, they made uſe of this diſtinction,
that it was not lawfull indeed for a <hi>private man</hi> to
do <hi>evil</hi> at his own pleaſure <hi>that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
and this was only that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe
words did prohibit, but it was lawfull notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the common-Council of a Nation to whoſe
care it doth belong that the <hi>Common-wealth ſhould
receive no detriment</hi> to do it, if the <hi>publick neceſſity</hi>
and the <hi>ſafety of the people</hi> do ſo require; <hi>What</hi> and
how much is to be done for the ſafety of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
I ſhall hereafter God willing examine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine:
In the mean time it is in the firſt place to
be obſerved that this is but an extravagant ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that there is nothing in the whole diſcourſe
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> on which that diſtinction may rely. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
If we ſhall mark the force, and the ſcope of
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument in this place, we ſhall perceive
that all ſuch limitations, and ridiculous inventions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:154344:46"/>
of deceitfull men, for the <hi>Apostle</hi> here meets with
the objection for promoting the <hi>glory of God,</hi> by the
ſins of men, he denyeth that <hi>evil</hi> is to be done for
that <hi>end</hi> to render the <hi>glory of God</hi> more illuſtrious.
It followeth therefore, <hi>a fortiori, from the stronger,</hi>
that no evill things are to be done, for any thing that
is inferiour to the <hi>glory of God;</hi> And ſeeing the
<hi>glory of God</hi> is infinitely to be preferred to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<hi>good</hi> whatſoever, whether <hi>publick,</hi> or <hi>private,</hi>
and it is not lawfull notwithſtanding to do evil for
<hi>Gods glory,</hi> certainly it is not lawfull for a <hi>private
man</hi> or for the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of a whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
for the redreſſe of any <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience</hi>
to do <hi>evil</hi> themſelves, or to commend it to
be done by another.</p>
            <p>XXIV. Let us meditate I beſeech you (my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers)
on theſe things with our ſelves and that moſt
ſeriouſly, and the worſe that the dayes are, and the
more that the ſnares of temptation are, and the
aſſaults more violent, let us walk the more exactly,
and look unto our ſteps with a greater circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
let us not ſuffer our ſelves by any machinations
of the Devills, or allurements of fleſh &amp; the world
to be led aſide, though never ſo little, from that
right, &amp; that ſtreight path of the Commandments of
God; carrying allwayes in our memoryes that the
<hi>evils</hi> which wittingly and willfully we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
ſhall find no excuſe in that day when <hi>God
ſhall be our Iudge,</hi> and our <hi>Conſciences our witneſſes,</hi>
And thus much concerning the pretence of a <hi>good
Intention:</hi> what remaineth to be ſpoken concerning

THIRD LECTURE,
In which is declared that neither in
the examples of good men, nor
the judgment of experienced
men, there is protection e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſecure the
Conſcience.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving propounded to my ſelf to
examine and diſcover to you the
<hi>adaequate rule of Conſcience</hi> which
is to be the certain and ſafe Law
how to lead our lives; I conceived
it in the firſt place moſt neceſſary,
to declare unto you in what a grievous &amp; dangerous
errour they are, who think in the things they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:154344:47"/>
do they provide well enough for the ſecurity
of their own Conſciences, if either by the flattering
intention of ſome <hi>good end,</hi> or the <hi>example</hi> of ſome
holy man, or the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> of a man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for learning and <hi>piety,</hi> they can any ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves and what they have done; And
truly how little protection there is in a bare <hi>good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
either as to the benefit of the Conſcience or
the confidence of any good work, without the other
concomitants of it, I think hath been ſufficiently
declared by me in my former Lecture, where by
many reaſons I have convinced, that <hi>no evil is to be
done that good may enſue thereby.</hi> It remaineth that
this day, I do repreſent unto you, that neither the
<hi>example</hi> nor the <hi>judgment</hi> of any man ought to be
of ſo great <hi>authority</hi> with us, that our <hi>Conſciences</hi>
may ſecurely reſt in either of them; and neither
from that alone can we duely conclude, that all
things which are paſſed are rightly done, or thoſe
things for the time to come are ſimply lawfull to be
done, which another man indued with never ſo
much <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>ſanctity</hi> hath either done
himſelf, or hath judged lawfull to be put into
practice by another.</p>
            <p>II. Moreover, how unſafe it is to frame our lives
and actions to the examples of other men, and how
unſatisfying it is to the ſecurity of the Conſcience
to defend our ſelves by alledging, that whatſoever
we have done or are about to do, hath been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by ſome pious man before us, may by a moſt
cleer argument appear by the words of the
propoſed Text, eſpecially if we ſhall go a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and derive the ground and the occaſion of them
from the Hiſtory of the thing performed. St. <hi>Peter
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154344:48"/>
the Apoſtle</hi> living at <hi>Antioch</hi> amongſt the Gentiles
converted to the Chriſtian faith, who were not
bound inconſcience to the obſervation of the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> did freely eat with them, and did partake of
whatſoever meats were ſet before him, as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
as permitted to the people of the Jewes,
without the leaſt ſcruple according to the liberty
which he had in Chriſt. But when ſome Chriſtians
of the nation of the Jewes came to <hi>Antioch</hi> from
Jeruſalem, whither they were thoſe <hi>falſe brethren</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of whom mention is made in
the fourth verſe of this 2 of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that they came from <hi>James</hi> did indeed <hi>creep
in privily of themſelves,</hi> to obſerve the liberty of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and other Chriſtians, as ſome do think, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as others are of opinion, and more probably)
whether they were <hi>weak Brethren</hi> ſent indeed by St.
<hi>James,</hi> but as yet not throughly inſtructed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ceſſation of the Rites and Ceremonies of
the Law; St. <hi>Peter</hi> deſiring to be gracious with
them, or rather fearing to give them an offence, did
immediately, and altogether, abſtain from the Tables,
and the ſociety of the Gentiles, and from the <hi>meats</hi>
forbidden in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by whoſe example
the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> being induced, who by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of <hi>Paul</hi> and his <hi>fellow labourers</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> had
been taught the Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iberty a little better than
thoſe that came from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and more fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the aboliſhing of the ceremonial Law, yet
being but weak themſelves, and more addicted to
the ceremonies to which a long time they had been
accuſtomed, they eaſily ſuffered themſelves to be
ſeperated from the communion of their brethren
the believing Gentiles, not without ſome ſuſpition
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154344:48"/>
(as it is probable) that <hi>Peter</hi> the chief of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
was the more compent judge of theſe things, &amp;
what was to be done, &amp; that themſelvs were hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
drawn in by <hi>Paul</hi> with the gratefull but the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhew of liberty; and what is more to be admired
(for it is not ſtrange or unaccuſtomed for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſort to ſtumble) even <hi>Barnabas</hi> himſelf, who
was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> collegue, and his daily companion
in his journeys, who conſtantly aſſerted the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> againſt the Jews, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by the authority of ſo great an Apoſtle,
did ſtoop with him into the ſame fellowſhip
of diſſimulation, not without a great offence to the
believing Gentiles.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Paul</hi> doth here declare, that for this fact St.
<hi>Peter</hi> was reprehended by him, and that vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
openly, and deſervedly; Not only that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to the ſcandal of ſo many of the brethren, out
of too great deſire of complacence, or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fear of
offence; had ſhewed himſelf more favourable to
the Jewiſh ceremonies, than did become him, but
that he drew others by his example into the ſame
participation of Hypocriſie with him, and by the
ſame example had endeavouted to enforce the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Gentiles, although unwilling, and againſt
their Conſciences, unto <hi>Judaiſme:</hi> I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> (having alleged ſome other
Authors that jump with him in that opinion) doth
give a far different interpretation of this reproof,
than what I here have ſpecified, <hi>viz.</hi> That this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
was not carryed <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> and as indeed it was
betwixt theſe two <hi>chiefeſt</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and by <hi>contrivance,</hi> the benefit of
the Church at that time ſo requiring it. Indeed he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154344:49"/>
would perſwade us that this <hi>diſſimulation</hi> of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was neceſſary to retain the good opinion of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> which that it might not be too dangerous
to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> this <hi>counterfeit</hi> reproof of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was altogether as neceſſary, by which the <hi>errour of
the Jews,</hi> concerning the continuing force of the
<hi>ceremonial Rites</hi> might be ſo corrected, that by the
ſame endeavour, proviſion ſhould be made that no
danger of ſcandal ſhould be given to the Gentiles.
And thus by the conjoyned <hi>diſſimulation</hi> of both
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> it was ſo effected, that the Jewes as
well as the Gentiles ſhould by this <hi>pious fraud</hi> be
more eaſily retained, in the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which
not long they had imbraced. Theſe words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are ſo handſomly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by him to maintain his own opinion
(as above all other of the <hi>Fathers</hi> he is accuſtomed
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to ſerve thoſe aſſertions
which are but his own conjectures) that the words
he <hi>withſtood him to the face</hi> do not in his conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſignifie, <hi>openly,</hi> and <hi>before the people,</hi> or to his
<hi>own face,</hi> but only under <hi>a pretence</hi> and <hi>ſhew,</hi> and
according to the <hi>outward appearance,</hi> in which
conſtruction theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are by him
uſurped alſo, as it is manifeſt 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
            <p>IV. This opinion of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> was nothing
pleaſing to St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who denieth that any
thing was here done by <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>contrivance,</hi> but
that St <hi>Paul</hi> moſt ſincerely, and exprſsely did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelf to this unſeaſonable <hi>combination;</hi> he
therfore in a letter did very friendly admoniſh St.
<hi>Hierome</hi> of his errour,<note place="margin">Inter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou. Epiſt. 97.</note> who perſiſting more obſtinate
in his opinion, (letters being often ſent from the
one to the other) the queſtion began to be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154344:49"/>
betwixt them (as became the conteſtation of
two ſuch great wits) with much acuteneſſe on both
ſides, and with ſolid weights of <hi>reaſon;</hi> at the laſt
in the judgment of moſt men, the victory ſtood on
St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſide, and his arguments being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be more ſound, and more conſiderable,
but very few did adhere to the opinion of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome;</hi>
in which it is not to be wondred at, if <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
Baronius</hi> were one, who being carefull that
the affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not ſuffer any <hi>diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and that the <hi>infallibility</hi> of his <hi>Jove of the Capitoll</hi>
ſhould not grow into contempt, if any ſtain of
<hi>raſhneſs</hi> or <hi>error</hi> ſhould blemiſh the reputation of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or if any man ſhould be ſo bold to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rove
him, or to dare to open his mouth againſt
him, by ſaying, (<hi>Maſter why do you ſo.</hi>) doth here
uſe all his art and induſtry to crown with applauſe
the exploded opinion of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and to reſtore it
unto <hi>honor,</hi> though baniſhed, and begging for <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
all the world over; but truly this is that <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
(as every where he doth betray himſelf to be
partiall) who in his voluminous, and laborious
Chronicles did make it all his buſines to gratify the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to meaſure the faith and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of all <hi>monuments</hi> and the great <hi>moments</hi> of
all <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>teſtimonies</hi> by the dignity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the <hi>Sea of Rome.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> (to return
from whence I have digreſſed) did moſt iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
St. <hi>Peter</hi> his fellow Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that
is <hi>face</hi> to <hi>face</hi> (as the ſame phraſe is read in the 15
of the <hi>Acts</hi> and in other places) of <hi>importunate
diſſimulation,</hi> and this he did <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>openly</hi> before
all, and more eſpecially becauſe that by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
he had drawn <hi>Barnabas</hi> into an error, and the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154344:50"/>
               <hi>Jewes</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and given a great, and a greiveous
offence to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who had newly imbraced the
Chriſtian faith to the great danger and ſcandal of
the liberty of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>V. I have more willingly inlarged my ſelf upon
this, as well to give ſome light to a place heretofore
obſcure, and much controverted, as to make more
manifeſt the force of the argument which for the
confirmation of our <hi>poſition</hi> is deduced from this
diſcourſe <hi>of the Apoſtle.</hi> For St. <hi>Paul</hi> judged that
not only St. <hi>Peter</hi> who was the <hi>leading example,</hi> but
that <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and others alſo who followed him,
and did conſent to the ſame diſſimulation, were to
be noted, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as men that did not
<hi>tread with an upright foot,</hi> nor walked according to
the ſimplicity of the truth of Chriſt: By which it is
moſt evident, that, St. <hi>Paul</hi> being Judge, it would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no great advantage unto uncertain <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and
halting as it were betwixt <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi>
to call into the patronage of his diſſimulation
the <hi>example</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> although of the higheſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
amongſt the Apoſtles; but grant that <hi>Peter</hi>
was worthy of a ſharper reprehenſion, becauſe that
by his example he became a <hi>ſtumbling block</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nevertheleſs <hi>Barnabas</hi> is not the more to be
excuſed, that he tranſgreſſed by following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of another; And this may ſuffice concerning
our firſt <hi>argument</hi> taken from the Text of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. The ſecond argument is derived from the
<hi>difficulty</hi> of <hi>judging,</hi> for ſeeing that all the deeds of
the righteous are not to be imitated, it is no obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing to underſtand what deeds of theirs are to
be <hi>examplar;</hi> and what not; and that by reaſon of a
<hi>twofold uncertainty</hi> that is in them; For it may ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154344:50"/>
come to paſſe both ways, that what a righteous man
hath done, may not be <hi>well done,</hi> and hath been well
done by him, is nevertheleſs not to be imitated by us.
In the firſt place moſt certain it is, that thoſe deeds
of theirs which are <hi>ill done</hi> are not to be imitated,
and that the moſt holy of men have had their ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes,
and infirmities, it having pleaſed the moſt
wiſe God to permit them to fall ſometimes into
the moſt grievous ſins, of <hi>murder, adultery, idolatry,</hi>
and the <hi>renouncing of their faiths,</hi> that they might
conſider that they are but men, and by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that they as well do pertake with, as they do
pardon the miſtreadings of another, that ſo they
might not truſt in their own ſtrengths againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
but depend altogether on the aſſiſtance of
God, and if <hi>unconquered, unſhaken,</hi> or <hi>unhurt</hi> they
have ſuſtayned the moſt violent aſſaults of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that they may acknowledge it to proceed
wholy from the <hi>providence,</hi> and the <hi>grace</hi> of God;
and it hath pleaſed <hi>him who worketh all in all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the counſels of his own will,</hi> that ſome of their
<hi>foulest defects</hi> ſhould <hi>punctually</hi> be expreſſed in the
book of <hi>holy Writ,</hi> that ſo <hi>illuſtrious, and never dying
examples</hi> ſhould remain unto all ages, on the one ſide
of humane <hi>frailty</hi> and <hi>inconſtancy,</hi> and on the other
of the <hi>Divine goodneſs and mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. Peradventure it will be here objected. It
is true indeed, that thoſe Examples of the Saints
are not to be imitated, which in the word of God
are expreſſely noted to be ill done, for what ſober
man will propound unto himſelf either the <hi>abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the <hi>adultery of David,</hi> as exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for him to imitate; Nevertheleſſe it doth ſeem
that we may ſafely take examples from thoſe acts of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154344:51"/>
theirs which are ſo recorded in the Scriptures, that
they are there as free from <hi>dispraiſe,</hi> as from any
tincture of <hi>guilt;</hi> I make anſwer, that this is not
to be done, for in the Scriptures (as every where in
other Hiſtories) the deeds of many men are only <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically</hi>
and nakedly related, juſt as they were done,
&amp; are neither expreſſely <hi>commended,</hi> or <hi>diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
by the Writers, notwithſtanding it is not to be
doubted, that ſome of them were unjuſt, ſome of
them diſhoneſt, and far from the duty of a godly
man; And many other things there are recorded of,
which we may not undeſervedly doubt, whether
they were well done or ill done, concerning which
the Interpreters are accuſtomed to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
probably and liberally on both ſides; Of
ſuch a nature is that act of <hi>Lot,</hi> offering the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Daughters Virginities to the impure Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and that act of <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſwearing as it is
thought by the life of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

craftily ſtealing from <hi>Eſau</hi> his brother, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction
of his father; and many other examples of
the ſame nature, which if any man ſhall adventure
to follow, on this preſumption only, that he hath
read the ſame things to be acted by godly men, and
not to be condemned, he ſhall object himſelf to a
moſt certain <hi>danger</hi> of errour and of ſin, by <hi>ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
his Conſcience to a moſt uncertain Law.</p>
            <p>VIII. But you will ſay, we may ſafely howſoever
follow thoſe examples which expreſſely are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in the world of God; I make anſwer, that
even <hi>this</hi> alſo is not <hi>ſimply</hi> to be granted, for in the
firſt place I ſay, that whatſoever <hi>deeds</hi> of men are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
condemned in the word of God to be vitious,
they are ſimply to be eſchewed; for the ſtrength
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:154344:51"/>
and uſe of bad examples are more powerfull to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
<hi>negatively</hi> upon them, than of good examples
to argue <hi>affirmatively,</hi> which manner of arguing out
Apoſtle uſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 6. &amp;c. where having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
out of the Hoſtory of the old Teſtament
the examples of ſeveral ſorts of ſins, as alſo of the
<hi>judgments</hi> of God upon the prevaricators of his Law,
he doth admoniſh that all of us would look upon
them as <hi>types</hi> and examples, not to imitate, but to
eſchew them. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>IX. In the ſecond place I do affirm that what
<hi>Deeds</hi> in the Scriptures are expreſſely prayſed, and
are ſo prayſed, that they may ſeem to be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us for Examples, are notwithſtanding not
ſuddainly, and headily to be followed by us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muſt we imagine that the whole aggregate
Action, as it was at firſt performed, is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto us to imitate; But we muſt uſe <hi>choyce</hi> and
<hi>caution</hi> to imitate thoſe things which are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
on that part only of them, and intirely on
that account for which they are commended. The
reaſon of this <hi>Caution</hi> is, becauſe that God
oftentimes in a <hi>mixt Action</hi> according to his infinite
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154344:52"/>
goodneſſe, doth <hi>approve</hi> and look upon that only in
it which is <hi>Good,</hi> and doth paſſe by, and as it were
takes no notice of that in it which is <hi>Evil;</hi> As in the
16 <hi>Luke 8. The Lord prayſed the unjuſt Steward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had done wiſely;</hi> although in the ſame Act
he had hazarded the <hi>Reputation</hi> of his <hi>Truſt.</hi> The
<hi>Wiſdome</hi> therefore, and not the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> of that
Steward, is to be imitated; Again in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
Example of the <hi>Egyptian Midvives</hi> preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the new-born of the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

excuſing their contempt of the Kings Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
their <hi>Lye</hi> is not to be numbred with their

               </gap>y to be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and diſtinguiſhed from it, for their <hi>Lye</hi> was
a Vice, and not to be followed, but their <hi>humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and their <hi>piety</hi> is prayſed by God, and they both
deſerve our <hi>Imitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>X. In the third place I ſay, that the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>atchievements</hi> of the <hi>Worthyes</hi> are prayſed in the
Scriptures which, being ſtirred up by a peculiar
motion and inſpiration of the holy Spirit they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as it were by a peculiar mandate, and
beyond the ordinary Law, and yet notwithſtanding
thoſe <hi>atchievements</hi> are not to be followed. Of this
Nature, is that remarkable Act of <hi>Phineas,</hi> for
which he received both <hi>commendations</hi> and <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi>
from God himſelf, for being but a private
Man, and inveſted with no Lawful Authority, he did
notwithſtanding with his Spear, run through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of thoſe two ſhameleſſe perſons, whom he
had taken in the Act of Incontinency. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.
8. And of the ſame nature was that of <hi>Elias</hi> the
Prophet, who having called <hi>Fire</hi> down from Heaven
deſtroyed the Souldiers that were ſent to ſecure
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154344:52"/>
him. 2 <hi>Kings 4. 10. &amp;c.</hi> Which Act of his, when
two of the Diſciples of Chriſt <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to imitate, having asked counſel of their
Maſter concerning it, he was ſo far from approving
their raſh deſires,<note place="margin">Luke 9 54</note> that he did reject them, and
gave a great check to their Chole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick Importunity,
<hi>You know not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of what Spirit you are;</hi> As
if he ſhould have ſaid, forbear the extravagant
heats of your unquiet minds, and contain your ſelves
within the bounds of your Vocation; If <hi>Elias</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
did any thing ſeverely, do not you ſuppoſe
that the ſame thing is fitting to be performed by
you. That which he did, was effected by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Spirit of God, which inwardly did ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
and dictate to him, and was like unto that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Mandate which was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill
his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> But this belongs not to you whom the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath not yet called to the Execution
of ſo extraordinary and ſo high a charge, you ought
not to entertain any thought of attempting it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XI. Seeing therefore it is not alwayes certain
that what hath been performed by a Godly Man,
ought to be commended, and though it hath been
commended, it ought not unpremeditately to be
imitated, it is far more conducible to the ſecurity
of our Conſciences to bring home and conform our</hi>
Deeds <hi>to the</hi> Rule <hi>of the</hi> Law <hi>which is</hi> certain, <hi>than
to follow the</hi> uncertain Examples <hi>of Men. Moſt
true is that of St.</hi> Auguſtine, Haec quae in Scripturis
Sanctis legimus, non ideò quià facta credimus, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
facienda credamus: ne violemus praecepta, dum
paſſim ſectamur exempla. We ought not to believe that
theſe things which we read in the Holy Scriptures, are
therefore to be done again, becauſe, that already they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154344:53"/>
have been performed, leaſt we violate the precepts,
whiles every where we do follow the Examples. <hi>And
after other words to the ſame purpoſe, he doth
thus conclude;</hi> Unde conſtat, quod non omnia quae à
Sanctis et juſtis viris legimus facta transfere debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ad mores. From hence it is manifeſt, that we
ought not to tranſlate all things into practice and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
which we do read to have been performed by holy
and juſt men. <hi>And thus far of our</hi> ſecond Argument
<hi>concerning the difficulty of judging the examples of
Godly men by reaſon of the great uncertainty which
is in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XII. The third Argument followeth, taken from
the difficulty of <hi>rightly applying</hi> the Examples of
other men, to our own Affairs and Actions, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the <hi>uncertainty of the Circumſtances</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an infinite variety, do alſo infinitely vary
the qualities of humane Actions; That which is
<hi>free</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> in the <hi>Theſis,</hi> that is, the <hi>Poſitions,</hi> is ſo
alſo in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> or <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> the ſame <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
remaining, I call that <hi>lawful</hi> which may be
done without <hi>Sin,</hi> and that <hi>free,</hi> which without <hi>Sin</hi>
may be omitted; now the ſame thing (any one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
being added or taken away, or any wayes
changed) may be made <hi>unlawful</hi> of that which was
<hi>Lawful,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> of that which before was
<hi>free;</hi> and this we ſee every day by Experience in
our Courts of <hi>Law,</hi> when pleadings are made at the
Bar, where by the advocate of one ſide, the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Examples of <hi>Caſes</hi> before judged are cited for
the advantage of their Cauſe, and it is anſwered by
the Advocate of the other ſide, that there is not in
both <hi>Caſes</hi> the ſame <hi>Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> that the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are varyed, from whence it comes to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:154344:53"/>
paſſe that the <hi>Caſe</hi> is altered, and thoſe things
which were cited to be <hi>reported,</hi> and to be <hi>judged
of before;</hi> do not appertain to the Suit now in
Controverſie; But if that rightly the <hi>Caſe</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
the whole frame of the Defence which
did ſupport it ſelf on this Foundation, doth preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall to the ground; And the <hi>precedent</hi> taken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
of the things that have been ſo judged, will
be of no moment at all with the <hi>Judges.</hi> From
hence it comes to paſſe, that amongſt the ſeveral
kinds of Argumentation with Logicians, the <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum</hi>
or <hi>Example</hi> is ranked amongſt the laſt, as more
fit to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> than to demonſtrate a thing. And
certainly if that of <hi>Fabius</hi> be true, <hi>Tot ſeculis nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
repertam eſſe cauſam quae ſit tota alteri ſimilis;
In ſo many ages there hath never yet any cauſe been
found which hath been altogether like to one another;</hi>
Its likely enough that very eaſily he may Erre,
who by the condition of <hi>one cauſe</hi> doth haſtily paſſe
his Judgement on <hi>another</hi> like unto it, having not
firſt with all diligence weighed with himſelf the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of them both.</p>
            <p>XIII. In which conſideration we are ſo much the
more ready to fall into an error becauſe we are moſt
of us of ſuch a temper, that in the application of the
examples of others unto our ſelves, we only look
upon the bare <hi>fact,</hi> and greedily make uſe of it by
enforcing it to our purpoſe, eſpecially if it ſeems to
comply with our affections, and the <hi>deſires</hi> of our
hearts, in the mean time taking not into our leaſt
conſideration, either the cauſes of the <hi>fact,</hi> or of
the <hi>end,</hi> or the manner of the circumſtances of it,
eſpecially if they are not ſuitable or complacent
unto us. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> in the ſixth Chapter,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154344:54"/>
and fifth verſe, doth reprove ſome of his time, who
in the midſt of publick calamities, being too ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and ſecure, did delight themſelves in Riot and all
manner of pleaſures, and amongſt other things did
whiſper unto themſelves <hi>that like unto David they
did invent unto themſelves instruments of Muſick,</hi> as
if they ſhould have ſaid, <hi>why ſhould that be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in us to be a Vice,</hi> which was a <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>honour</hi>
unto <hi>David.</hi> That Holy Man did exerciſe himſelf
in Pſalms, and Inſtruments of Muſick; And we do
the like; but in the mean time we do diſſemble
with our ſelves, and fail in that which principally
was to be imitated in <hi>David,</hi> for he did it to the
<hi>Honour of God,</hi> and the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of his <hi>worſhip</hi> in
<hi>publick,</hi> and not to the <hi>exceſſe</hi> in Bankettings, and
the fomenting of <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIV. The Rhetoricians do give many Precepts
concerning Imitation in Oratory, to wit, that it
will be profitable for him who would be an <hi>Orator</hi>
to propound unto himſelf ſome remarkable perſon,
who is excellent in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Speaking</hi> whom
he muſt indeavour to imitate; which alſo the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
do make mention of as a ſalubrious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
for the inſtitution of our lives. <hi>Seneca</hi> doth
exhort us to the Example of ſome famous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
perſon for the better compoſition of our
lives, &amp; manners, <hi>for the way by precepts, he ſaith, is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
which is made but ſhort and more effectual by
Examples. Examples</hi> moreover do carry with
them a kind of ſecret delight, and have joyned to
them as much profit as perſwaſion, as we may ſee
in little Children, who unwillingly do obey the
commands of others, but take a great pleaſure to
imitate their Acts; Thoſe men nevertheleſſe who
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154344:54"/>
give theſe Counſels do withal adviſe us, that to <hi>live
well and happily,</hi> we ought to have a ſound judgment
to make a wiſe choice, both of the men whom we
would propound unto our ſelves for examples, and
of the things themſelves which we are to imitate;
<hi>Fabius</hi> derides thoſe weak Orators, who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a vain affectation, and empty circumſtance of
words, to imitate the ſtyle of <hi>Cicero,</hi> do conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive
they have performed ſomething rare and happy if
they can often but conclude with an <hi>eſſe videatur;</hi>
And <hi>Tully</hi> himſelf doth reprove the perverſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of ſome men in this particular, who having
propounded to themſelves ſome famous Orator for
examples, do imitate nothing of them but their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;
Such a man was <hi>Fuſius</hi> an evil imitator
of a good Orator, <hi>Caius Fimbria, Nervos Caii Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briae
in dicendo,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tully) non aſſequitur, oris
pravitatem imitatur, He attains not to the ſoundneſſe
and pithineſſe of Caius Fimbria in speaking, he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
only the imperfection of his ſpeech. Nazianzen</hi>
relateth that <hi>Bazil</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> (by reaſon
of his great piety, and learning, called commonly
<hi>Bazil</hi> the great) was had in ſuch a reverent eſteem
by all men, that not a few did ſtudiouſly affect, and
ſtrove to have ſome reſemblance of his bodily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
as of the paleneſs of his countenance, his
ſlow gate, and pronunciation of his words, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defects of his body. In the ſame nature others
do atteſt, that there were not ſome wanting who
with all their induſtry did endeavour to counterfeit
the <hi>drawling</hi> of the great Orator <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and
the <hi>ſtammering</hi> of the famous Philoſopher <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
O Imitatores ſervum pecus!</hi> ſaith <hi>Horace, 1
Epiſt.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:154344:55"/>
XV. Theſe things and a thouſand more like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, which every day we read of in approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
being all of them the examples of a <hi>perverſe
imitation,</hi> would provoke our mirth rather than our
choler, if this perverſneſs conſiſted only in <hi>words</hi> &amp;
in the outward <hi>habit and geſture of the body,</hi> and had
no place at all in our <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>manners.</hi> But here
alſo, nothing peradventure more unfrequently, but
certainly far more dangerouſly, <hi>Decipit examplar
vitiis imitablie, The example doth deceive being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
reſembled,</hi> whiles too indulgent to our own
affections, and tranſported by the pravity of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
out of the abundant heaps of examples, we
make choice of thoſe moſt willingly, and in them
doe moſt vehemently urge thoſe <hi>circumſtances,</hi>
which ſeem moſt ſuitable to that ſide, to which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
our minds do incline, that ſowe may the better
ſerve our vain <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>deſires.</hi> And this, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall more diligently peruſe the books pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Browniſts</hi> and other
Sectaries, of that complexion, or what ſome few
years before have been written by their true prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
the <hi>Puritan Reformers</hi> he ſhall moſt readily
find to be egregiouſly performed by thoſe who make
it their buſineſſe to diſturb the <hi>order</hi> of the Church &amp;
the peace of the Common-wealth, and that I may
give you ſome teſtimony of the perverſeneſs of theſe
mens ſpirits, (which I hope I ſhall perform without
juſt offence to any ſober man) give me leave I pray
you but briefly to examine one of their arguments,
taken (as they alledge from the example of <hi>Christ</hi>
and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) which being handled large enough,
and with great animoſity by them how ſolidly, and
ſincerely they have carryed themſelves therein, I
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:154344:55"/>
ſhall leave it unto you to judge.</p>
            <p>XVI. About forty years ſince there came forth
a book publiſhed by ſome Miniſters of the Dioceſſe
of Exceſter (for there were many heads and hands
in it) againſt the <hi>Rite</hi> of kneeling at the receiving
of the Sacrament. Amongſt other arguments which
they had every where ſought for, and brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they ſeemed to triumph moſt in this, which they
ſay was taken from the example of Chriſt himſelf,
The ſum and ſtrength of the argument lyes in this.
It is not lawfull for a Chriſtian in any religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pertaining to the worſhip of God, to recede a jot
from the example of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, the
action being imitable, as every action of Chriſt is to
be imitated, and being rightly followed by others,
ought to be imitated as well by all Chriſtians; But
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did receive the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in another poſture than kneeling, therefore we
Chriſtians alſo ought to do the like; This ſo weak
and ſo pittyfull a Sophiſm, being impoſed not only
on the unlearned people but on others alſo, who, if
they were more wiſe, it would be better with the
Church of Chriſt, it will not be labour loſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
ſome things unto you which may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
demonſtrate to you the vanity of the whole
argumentation.</p>
            <p>XVII. In the firſt place therefore, obſerve that
here is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a tranſition to a
thing of another kind, which is ſo foul an errour
that it is hardly to be pardoned in School-boys, for
the whole controverſie being altogether of the geſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
they diſpute here with much importunity on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Subject, which is of <hi>Actions</hi> only. Let us
grant that <hi>every action of Chriſt</hi> is to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:154344:56"/>
but who will ſay that <hi>geſture</hi> is an <hi>action,</hi>
there being ſo wide a diſparity and and diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt them, that they are not in the capacity
of one common <hi>Genus,</hi> but do properly belong to
two diſtinct praedicaments, for <hi>geſture</hi> belongeth to
<hi>Situs</hi> or the praedicament of <hi>poſture,</hi> and <hi>Action</hi> to
another proper praedicament of its own name.</p>
            <p>XVIII. In the ſecond place obſerve, that the
four laſt praedicaments are of a <hi>lower extract, viz.
Ubi, Quando, Situs,</hi> and <hi>Habitus,</hi> the <hi>where,</hi> the <hi>when,</hi>
the <hi>geſture,</hi> and <hi>habit,</hi> are almoſt of one eſtimation
and account in reſpect of thoſe <hi>actions</hi> to which as it
were they are added as Concomitants, for they are
nothing elſe but ſome <hi>relations</hi> of an inferiour note,
and <hi>circumſtances</hi> altogether extrinſical to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
themſelves; It ſeems not therefore agreeable
to reaſon that by the force of the <hi>example of Christ
&amp; the Apoſtles</hi> we ſhould be obliged to the imitation
of one of them only, which is in the <hi>geſture,</hi> &amp; that
in the other three, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>where,</hi> the <hi>when,</hi> and the
<hi>habit,</hi> we have no obligation even in the judgment
of thoſe men who do urge this example; For as to
the <hi>where</hi> they themſelves do not hold it neceſſary
whether the <hi>Sacrament</hi> or <hi>holy Euchariſt</hi> be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>private houſes</hi> below or in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
room thereof; Neither do they hold themſelves
obliged as to the <hi>when,</hi> whether it be after ſupper,
or in the dusk of the Evening, nor as to the <hi>habit,</hi>
whether it be ſolemnized by a Miniſter in a <hi>Semea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
coat,</hi> notwithſtanding that all theſe particulars
were obſerved in the firſt <hi>inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>ſupper,</hi> it
is apparent in the ſacred Hiſtory, neither is it deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by themſelves; Since therefore they themſelves
do aſſume the <hi>liberty,</hi> and do grant it unto others,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:154344:56"/>
that with a ſafe Conſcience it is lawfull for them
in all theſe things to recede from the practice of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I would willingly learn
from theſe new maſters what it is that is ſo ſingular
in the praedicament of <hi>Situs,</hi> or of <hi>geſture,</hi> that it is
ſo much to be ranked either above or beneath the
eſtimation of the reſt of its Conſorts, &amp; it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
without great Sacriledge to ſtartle the leaſt on
this ſide or on that ſide from that <hi>primitive example.</hi>
Surely it is but reaſon that theſe four praedicaments
ſhould either go hand in hand, or walk with an even
pace together, or ſome reaſon for the difference
ſhould be aſſigned, that we may underſtand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not to be done, which as yet, as far as
I can learn, they have neither performed, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</p>
            <p>XIX. In the third place obſerve again, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every <hi>Act examplar</hi> ought to be ſo certain that
it cannot be denyed, it is not ſo cleerly manifeſt by
any Text of Scripture, that ſhould it be denyed,
that could be proved which they aſſume, and I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
will grant, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt and the Apoſtles
did not celebrate that <hi>firſt Supper</hi> with bended knees
but in ſome other geſture. But they will object
doth not that word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Goſpels intimat
only a <hi>triclinary geſture,</hi> by lying along on a bed,
which was familiar to thoſe times, and Countries?
I anſwer, <hi>no,</hi> &amp; altogether do deny, that any certain
kind of <hi>geſture</hi> can be proved by the ſignification only
of that word. From that kind of geſture which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
at Dinner or Supper was uſed in Parlours was
the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> derived, and the Latin
word <hi>diſcumbere</hi> which is to <hi>ſit</hi> or to <hi>lye down,</hi> but
he will put the weight and force of the words in a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154344:57"/>
very unrighteous ballance, whoſoever, after they are
grown more old by uſe, and of a far larger extent,
ſhall endeavour to bring them back again to their
firſt Cradles, &amp; to include them within their antient
limits. Thoſe two words therefore in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
uſe of ſpeaking, do ſignifie that <hi>act</hi> by which
we do purpoſely and uſually apply our ſelves in
ſome commodious place to eat our meat, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<hi>geſture</hi> or <hi>poſture</hi> of the body it be done,
whether it be by <hi>ſtanding,</hi> or <hi>ſitting,</hi> or <hi>kneeling,</hi> or
<hi>lying down,</hi> properly or improperly ſo called.</p>
            <p>XX. But although by the force of the word in
the original we cannot prove it, yet (by ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the Hiſtory) it may very probably
be collected, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in that firſt
Supper, did uſe a <hi>triclinary geſture</hi> by lying along
on beds, where in the fourth place obſerve, that our
new Dictators do not obey themſelves that Law
which they impoſe upon the Conſciences of others;
For if Chriſt in the inſtitution of the holy Supper
did uſe a <hi>triclinary geſture,</hi> his feet, and all the
lower part of his body being ſtretched forth on a
bed, and leaning with the upper part thereof on his
elbow, why do not theſe men, who are ſo hot upon
it in their diſputations imitate this example of
Chriſt, which undoubtedly they may? why do they
not provide themſelves with <hi>beds,</hi> and <hi>parlours</hi> that
ſo being provided with all things neceſſary, they may
be made partakers of the <hi>holy Table</hi> in the ſame <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi>
which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> uſed? From which
geſture it is moſt certain that thoſe doe differ who
either <hi>ſtand</hi> or <hi>ſit,</hi> (the one of which they both do
themſelves, and perſwade others to it (as much
as thoſe who kneel upon their knees: If
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154344:57"/>
they ſhall object, as ſome of them do, that in this
Weſtern part of the world, the <hi>tricliniary geſture</hi> is
out of uſe, and therefore we are not obliged to the
<hi>ſame poſture in the ſame ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ifical manner of it,</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
by the force of that primitive example we are
bound to obſerve the ſame poſture as to the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of it, that is, that at leaſt we may uſe the <hi>Table
geſture</hi> which according to the cuſtome of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is <hi>anological</hi> and ſucceſſive to it, as they
then uſed that <hi>geſture,</hi> which after the faſhion of
thoſe times and places was accuſtomed to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
But let them feed the people with ſuch
deceits; Is it poſſible for men out of a <hi>prejudicate</hi>
affection, and a vain <hi>deſire of contradicting</hi>
to ſink ſo much from underſtanding as to thruſt into
the world ſuch empty conceits for ſolid ones, or to
think to impoſe on any ſober man ſuch ridiculous
aſſertions; which how vain, and how empty they
are, that I may briefly and cleerly ſhew, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
thoſe men that do ſo diſpute, directly and
without any tergiverſation to anſwer to theſe few
Interrogatories.</p>
            <p>XXI. In the firſt place I do demand, that ſeeing
it is ſo certain that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if he uſed the tricliniary
geſture, that he did not eat, neither <hi>ſitting</hi> nor <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
as ſure it is that he did not eat <hi>kneeling on his
knees,</hi> why by the power of the ſame example are
we not obliged in the act and inſtant of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
to abſtain as well from <hi>ſitting</hi> or from <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
as from <hi>kneeling?</hi> For by the ſame ſuppoſition
it doth follow that there is not any one of the ſaid
three Poſtures which is not as deſtitute of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Chriſt, as the other two. It is therefore
moſt right (as a little above was ſpoken of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:154344:58"/>
four laſt predicaments) that theſe three ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the ſame priviledge, and be either all of them <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi>
as guilty, or acquitted as blameleſſe; If they
ſhall reply, as it is their uſual refuge, that by the
cuſtom of the Nation <hi>ſitting</hi> or <hi>ſtanding</hi> did ſucceed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the <hi>triclinary Geſture</hi> and not <hi>kneeling.</hi> I demand in
the ſecond place, how comes it about, that only the
ſilent cuſtome of any Nation (ſuppoſe the Engliſh)
ſhould be of power, that <hi>ſitting</hi> or <hi>ſtanding</hi> ſhould
ſucceed rhe <hi>tricliniary geſture,</hi> or lying down on the
bed, at our <hi>common tables,</hi> and the poſitive Law
of the ſame Nation ſhould not ſuffice, that <hi>kneeling</hi>
ſhould ſucceed the ſame <hi>Geſture at the Sacred Table.</hi>
Can a Cuſtom changed without any publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſenſibly ſo prevail, that what before was not
<hi>un-decent,</hi> or <hi>un-lawful,</hi> muſt now no longer be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
and no longer <hi>lawful?</hi> Cannot a Law <hi>inacted</hi>
by <hi>Publick Authority,</hi> and eſtabliſhed by an expreſſe
conſent of the people, and allowed of by dayly uſe,
prevail, that what upon no lawful reaſons was ever
found to be ever unlawful, ſhould be eſteemed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
again for the time to come? Indeed, where
theſe two things <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> do fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
themſelves (as hardly they do in this caſe)
there is no man of a ſober underſtanding
but will acknowledge; that Cuſtome ſhould
give place to <hi>Law,</hi> and not <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Cuſtome.</hi>
In the third place, I demand of them, do they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
believe, or do they not believe, that he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſinneth immediately in that Act who receiveth the
<hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>bended knees?</hi> If they ſhall ſay that
he Sinneth, ſeeing that every Sin is a tranſgreſſion
of the Law of God, let them ſhew me ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in that Law againſt which he that ſo doth, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154344:58"/>
If they ſhall acknowledge that it may be
done without Sin, then by their own confeſſion
they will level their own <hi>Riſe,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all the force of their Arguments. In the
fourth place, ſuppoſe that the ſaid <hi>tricliniary
geſture</hi> had been aboliſhed before the firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of the <hi>Holy Supper,</hi> and that <hi>Sitting</hi> or <hi>Standing</hi>
did ſucceed it, ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> muſt
have eaten either <hi>Standing</hi> or <hi>Sitting,</hi> both of which
could not be uſed at one time; I demand if they
had eaten <hi>Standing,</hi> whether it were ſo neceſſary for
us to ſtand alſo, that we ſhould have ſinned if we
had ſate, and on the contrary, or whether we
might have been free to have uſed which we would?
If they ſhould ſay, that we are free for both, the
Argument taken from the Example of Chriſt, will
be of no power, and will fall to the Ground, for
he uſed only but one of the ſaid Geſtures, and not
both of them. If they ſhall ſay again, that we are
preciſely bound up to the obſervation of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
which is ſuppoſed was uſed by our Saviour,
wherefore do theſe ſo ſevere Dictators, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulers
of the Liberty of every Church, admit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them an Indulgence of <hi>Standing</hi> or <hi>Sitting</hi> at the
<hi>Holy Supper,</hi> but not of kneeling, or of that poſture
which it is moſt probable, that our Saviour uſed?
In the fifth place I demand, If the Example of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Chriſt doth oblige us to the Imitation of it, why is
this obligation preciſely determined in that poſture,
which is but a ſubalternate <hi>Species,</hi> and hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to ſome higher <hi>Genus,</hi> or why doth it not
fall lower to ſome more <hi>inferiour Species?</hi> To make
it more obvious to your underſtandings, ſeeing thoſe
three things are to be conſidered. The <hi>gesture</hi> or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:154344:59"/>
Poſture it ſelf, as a <hi>ſuperior Genus,</hi> the <hi>Poſture at
the Table</hi> as a <hi>Species ſubalternate</hi> to it; And the
Poſture of lying along and leaning, as the <hi>loweſt
Species;</hi> And it is probable that Chriſt uſed the laſt
according to the cuſtom and practice of thoſe
Times, and Climates, why muſt the <hi>poſture</hi> only
at the <hi>Table,</hi> which is but an <hi>intermedial</hi> and a <hi>ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate
Species</hi> be accounted neceſſary and ſufficient
to the true Imitation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not any other
<hi>poſture</hi> ſufficient in the <hi>Genus</hi> of it, or why may not
the <hi>poſture</hi> of <hi>Leaning</hi> and <hi>lying along</hi> be as neceſſary
in the <hi>Species.</hi> Laſtly I demand, Is the <hi>poſture</hi> of
<hi>leaning and lying along</hi> practiſed by our Saviour and
the Apoſtles at the firſt inſtitution of the Holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be imitated or not? I am confident they
will not deny that it is to be imitated, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they cannot deny it, becauſe from thence they
do derive the chiefeſt ground and foundation of their
Cauſe; For thus they do propound the examples
of Chriſt of neceſſity to be imitated by us, that is
to ſay, not every example ſimply in it ſelf, but every
example that may be practiſed by us; I Only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this argumentation take <hi>that</hi> which they of
their own accord do grant, which is, 1ſt. the <hi>propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That every imitable example of Chriſt</hi> doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
a Chriſtian to the imitation of it. And 2ly. the
<hi>aſſumption,</hi> that the <hi>poſture</hi> in the <hi>Species</hi> of it which
Chriſt uſed in the holy Supper whatſoever it was is
<hi>imitable.</hi> From theſe premiſes I infer this concluſion;
By the force therfore of this example, ſay I <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
of the next age unto our Saviour, were obliged to
the ſame <hi>poſture</hi> in the ſame Species which he uſed,
And in the ſame manner were Chriſtians of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third age, ever ſince, unto theſe preſent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154344:59"/>
times; And it muſt accordingly be acknowledged that
the Church of Chriſt even at this time alſo is obliged
to the practice of the <hi>tricliniary</hi> or <hi>leaning poſture,</hi> if
indeed Chriſt did uſe it, or at leaſt it muſt be ſhown,
at what <hi>time</hi> and on what <hi>account,</hi> and by what <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
and <hi>Authority</hi> the force of this obligation
is made void.</p>
            <p>XXII. By theſe things which have been ſpoken
it is manifeſt that all the force of their <hi>Argument</hi>
which with ſo much pompe is dreſſed and held
forth by them, doth come to no more than this,
that it cannot more rightly or more commodiouſly
be propounded for their own purpoſe than under
this <hi>form.</hi> The example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles
doth ſo farre oblige, as we think it expedient that
it ſhall oblige, but we think it expedient that it ſhall
oblige to the not <hi>bending of the knee</hi> in the receiving
of the Sacrament, &amp; no further; therefore ſo farre
only, and not a jot further is the extent of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
I am aſhamed I confeſſe to furre your ears
with the repetition of theſe vanities, for it becomes
not this place, nor my age, or manners to <hi>provoke to
laughter in ſo ſerious a Subject.</hi> But what ſhall we
do with theſe men? A bad cauſe indeed doth need
ſuch a Patronage, and it cannot but come to paſs that
oftentimes they are enforced to ſpeak many vain and
incongruous things, and (if throughly they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined)
very abſurd ones, whoſoever they are, who
like unto thoſe men, do ſuffer themſelves to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by <hi>affectation</hi> rather than <hi>truth.</hi> I do ſpeak
from my heart and as indeed it is, although in their
writings we do meet with many things not ſolidly
argued, and ſometimes not ſincerely, yet I do not
remember that I have any where obſerved meer
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:154344:60"/>
trifles to be carryed on with ſo much animoſity and
contention, or the ſwelling Hills to bring forth a
more miſerable and ridiculous production, than
when the bare examples of good men in the holy
Scriptures are ſo importunately urged, either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
thoſe acts which by the law of God do ſeem to
be prohibited, or to induce an obligation upon the
Conſciences of men for the obſervation of thoſe
things which do not appeare by any law of God to
be commanded. But I return from whence I have
digreſſed, if have tranſgreſs'd at all, and proceed.</p>
            <p>XXIII. The fourth argument is taken from the
end, and proper uſe of examples, for we muſt duely
confeſſe, that examples in themſelves are of great
uſe, both for the inſtitution of our manners, and for
the amendment of our lives; And certainly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſo many <hi>precepts</hi> had not been left us in the
word of God, for whatſoever is there written is
written for our <hi>inſtruction</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Rom</hi> 15 4. And for our <hi>admonition,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
neither would the Apoſtles otherwiſe have
ſo conſtantly inclucated them. <hi>My brothers take
the Prophets for an example of patience, you have heard
of the patience of Job, Elias prayed, James</hi> 5. 19 11. 17.
Again, <hi>Be you followers of me as I am of Chriſt,
1 Cor. 11. 1. What you have heard and ſeen in me do
thoſe things Philip. 4. 9. Obſerve thoſe who ſo do,
walk as you have us for an example, Phil.</hi> 3. 17.
And the like in many places. But the uſe and end
of <hi>examples</hi> are not to be rules unto us for <hi>good live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
but only as <hi>helps</hi> and as it were <hi>spurs</hi> to ſhake
off our dulneſs, and to rouze our ſloth when we are
more heavy and dull in the performance of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
than indeed we ought to be. For humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:154344:60"/>
(eſpecially upon ſome great temptations, and
violent ſuggeſtions of the Devil and the World) is
commonly attended with many murmurings and
complaints againſt the <hi>ſecurity of the Law of God,</hi>
and the <hi>difficulty of giving obedience to it,</hi> nay often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is heard to cry out that there are Lyons in
our way, and that there are ſnares and ſtumbling
blocks laid under our feet to cauſe us to trip and
fall; that we muſt endure injuries, contumelies, and
calumnies, the plundring of our goods, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtering
of our Eſtates, the loſs of our dear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and of thoſe dearer pledges, our Wives, and
Children, and that with the loſſe of our friends, that
we muſt loſe our Countrey, nay even life it ſelf, and
become a hatred even to thoſe who moſt of all are
obliged to love us. How unpleaſing are theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes?
How unſupportable is the burden of this
oppreſſion? As often as theſe thoughts, and the
like, do invade our minds, ſo that we even begin to
deſpond all hope, and even to abandon the care of
all our duties, as of things impoſſible, which in vain
we do endeavour to perform, our languiſhing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are revived and rayſed by the ſeaſonable autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

of God, (which will not be wanting unto us if we
wholy depend upon it and faithfully adde our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
thereunto) have performed and endured
all thoſe things which by the help of God are to be
performed and to be endured by us, our ſpirits will

the importunity of ſin (which as it doth cloſely
embrace us, ſo if we uſe our beſt endeavours, by the
grace of God, will with no great difficulty abandon
us) we couragiouſly conſtantly and patiently do
run the race that is ſet before us.</p>
            <p>XXIV. St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle in his fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth exhort us to a fervency in prayer, after the
example of <hi>Elias,</hi> who by the importunity of his
prayer, did as it were at his pleaſure, lock and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
the Gates of Heaven; And that no man might
conceive, that it was to be imputed rather to the
ſanctity, and the merits of <hi>Elias,</hi> than to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of God to the prayers of the faithfull by the
Covenant of Grace: The Apoſtle in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this narration doth take away all occaſion
of ſuſpition, <hi>Elias</hi> (ſaith he) was a man <hi>the ſame
paſſions with us verſe</hi> 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He was a
man, not a God, or an Angell, nor made of better clay,
but out of the ſame <hi>maſſe</hi> out of which all other
men are faſhioned; This here urged is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
&amp; the moſt profitable uſe of <hi>examples,</hi> we ought
therefore to bear in our minds that <hi>examples</hi> are
not the <hi>rule</hi> it ſelf, neither do they carry with them
the <hi>weight</hi> or <hi>eſtimation</hi> of a <hi>rule;</hi> nay, if any doubt

               </gap>, or the

as it <hi>agreeeth with the original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what hitherto hath been ſpoken it may be
now made manifeſt, that it doth not ſuffice to prove
the goodneſs of any humane act, that it is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the <hi>example</hi> of ſome good and holy man;
and therefore no mans Conſcience can ſecurely
and ſafely acquieſſe therein, unleſs the <hi>example</hi> it
ſelf be comformable to the rule.</p>
            <p>XXV. Again, that we may now come to the other
part of our propoſition; The account is almoſt the
ſame of another mans <hi>judgment,</hi> as of his <hi>example,</hi>
and <hi>that</hi> almoſt for the ſame <hi>Cauſes,</hi> ſo that we need
not to make many words to enlarge our ſelves upon
this Subject, I will therefore run it over in as
few as I can.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, all men though <hi>godly</hi> and
<hi>learned</hi> are no leſs lyable unto errours, than they
are to ſins, nay peradventure much more, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to have a more acute inveſtigation of
the mind, to diſcover the difference betwixt <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> then betwixt <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> Firſt
by reaſon of that natural <hi>ignorance</hi> with which our
minds are darkened, and vaild as with a cloud. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154344:62"/>
by reaſon of our <hi>education,</hi> which faſhione
and formeth our minds, as yet but tender, and doth
imprint certain notions on them which it is no eaſy
task to expunge. Thirdly by reaſon of long <hi>uſe</hi> and
<hi>Cuſtome,</hi> which is as it were another nature. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by reaſon of the depraved affections which do
ecclipſe our judgments, and do hinder the right uſe
of them. From theſe and many other cauſes it is
ſo obvious unto men to <hi>erre,</hi> to <hi>fall,</hi> and to be <hi>decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
that it hath been long agoe a proverb,
<hi>Humanum est errare,</hi> It is the property of a man
to erre.</p>
            <p>XXVI. Adde to this in the ſecond place, that
not we our ſelves do not alwayes ſincerely judge of
their <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>wiſdome,</hi> whoſe <hi>Judgments</hi> we do
deſire to follow, it being very cuſtomary with
thoſe men who permit themſelves to be governed
by the arbitration of other men to make choice of
ſuch Conductors whom they before are confident
will lead them in that way in which before hand
they had determined to go themſelves. Thus doth
Satan hold faſt unwary men, being as it were inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in his circle. If you demand of them, why they
ſuppoſe ſuch a thing to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
Becauſe this, or that wiſe, and godly man hath
ſo taught us. If you again ſhall demand of them,
how they do know their Teacher to be a pious
and a prudent man; they anſwer, or at leaſt would
ſo anſwer, if they would ſpeak according to their
hearts, becauſe he thinketh as we do think.</p>

is, do not ſubmit your Conſciences to be governed by
the Authority of any man, according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and command.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. From theſe things which are thus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and proved, to give you now ſome few Coral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laryes,
and thoſe in a few words, it followeth in the
firſt place, that the inſupportable pride and tyranny
of the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ought moſt deſervedly to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by every true Chriſtian who by arrogating an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
judgment</hi> to himſelf, and to his chair, doth
by that name exerciſe an uſurping power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
over the Conſciences of men, and pretendeth
ſo much right thereunto, that if he ſhould ſay <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
were <hi>vices,</hi> and <hi>vices virtues,</hi> all Chriſtians are
bound under the penalty of mortal ſin, to ſubmit
to his judgment without the leaſt doubt, or ſcruple.
We are therefore with all thankfulnes to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the great and Singular goodnes and mercy of
Almighty God, who for theſe many years hath
freed us, and our fore-fathers, and the <hi>Church of
England</hi> from ſo unconſcionable a Tyranny, and
hath again reſtored us to our <hi>juſt liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIX. But we muſt all of us, and every one of us
take heed, that being freed now from that <hi>Tyranny,</hi>
we do not ſtoop our necks to a <hi>new bondage,</hi> leaſt
we be found not ſo much to have ſhaken off our
yoak, as to have changed it.</p>

It doth indeed concern us highly, if ſeriouſly
we would provide for the peace of our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or of the Church and Common-wealth, to
take care leaſt what heretofore was ſpoken of the
Church of Corinth; <hi>I am of Paul, I of Apollos,

No let God be true, and every man a Lyar;
He is not worthy to be Chriſts Diſciple, who is
not the Diſciple of Chriſt alone. The ſimplicity
and ſincerity of the Chriſtian Faith, hath ſuffered a
great prejudice ſince we have been divided into
parties; neither is there any hope that Religion
ſhould be reſtored to her former vigour and purity,
until the wounds made wider by our daily quarrels

we do ſuffer our ſelves to be ſo drawn aſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

things which have been here by me repreſented;
You are in the firſt place to be admoniſhed, that in
the Interpretation of the Scriptures, and in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Controverſies in reference to <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Manners,</hi> much Reverence and Authority is

which redoundeth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one, either in the reſpect of
the Fruit of his Conſcience to
excuſe thoſe things which he
hath done, or of the ſecurity of
it with confidence to undertake thoſe things which
he is about to do, if they only do rely upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
of a good <hi>End,</hi> or upon the Authority alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of another Judgement or Example, I have
abundantly declared in my two laſt Lectures, in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154344:65"/>
which my purpoſe was, thoſe ſtops being removed,
to make the way more plain &amp; ready to proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe things which I had determined to ſpeak, of
the <hi>obligation of Conſcience;</hi> which obligation being
two fold, <hi>Active,</hi> by which it bringeth one obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on another, and <hi>Paſſive,</hi> by which it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the obligation of another, the method
and privilege of order doth require that we ſhould
begin with the <hi>Paſſive;</hi> For then we more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can pronounce of the <hi>thing meaſured,</hi> when it is
once manifeſt that the <hi>meaſure</hi> it ſelf is juſt. Our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
therefore now in hand, is to <hi>inquire</hi> what <hi>that</hi>
is which properly doth <hi>oblige Conſcience,</hi> or, (which
is the ſame) what is the proper and <hi>Adaequate Rule
of Conſcience,</hi> to which, to <hi>be upright,</hi> it ought to
conform it ſelf; which inquiſition, that it may be
the more certain, and profitable, ſome few things
being premiſed by way of explication, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
at the laſt by certain concluſions to give
you an account of the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>II. In the firſt place therefore it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
that for the more exact performance of
the offices of <hi>Conſcience</hi> it is neceſſary to lay down
ſome <hi>Rules</hi> to which it ought to be ſubjected; for
whereſoever there is any <hi>Virtue active</hi> which of its
own Nature is not <hi>determined unto one thing</hi> in its
<hi>acting,</hi> but is in a <hi>Potentia</hi> to another, ſo
that it may act either well, or evilly; whether this
<hi>Virtue</hi> be a <hi>Habite</hi> of the firſt <hi>Species</hi> of Quality, or
a natural <hi>Potentia</hi> of the ſecond, it is neceſſary that
there ſhould be ſome <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi> which may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it in the <hi>acting;</hi> For as often as any thing doth
offer it ſelf to the Fancy to be done, whither repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the exterior ſence, or by ſome internal
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154344:65"/>
ſuggeſtion of the mind, becauſe the <hi>Will</hi> which is
the next <hi>principium</hi> of <hi>acting</hi> is (as commonly it is
ſpoken in the Schools) but <hi>Potentia caeca, a blind
Potentia,</hi> and of it ſelf cannot diſcern <hi>Good</hi> from
<hi>Evill,</hi> ſo as to be a <hi>Rule</hi> unto it ſelf, the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Reaſon</hi> doth ſtraight reflect on Conſcience, and
doth liſten to her <hi>Dictates.</hi> Now it is the Office of
Conſcience preſently to <hi>Examine</hi> the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
And the examination being made, to
<hi>Judge</hi> whether it ought to be performed, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed,
whether to be admitted or omitted, and
accordingly as ſhe hath judged, ſo preſently to
tranſmit her Judgement to the <hi>Will,</hi> that is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it to the <hi>Free-will,</hi> the ſame thing either to be
choſen, or diſliked; To which Office, of <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Judging,</hi> and <hi>Informing,</hi> leaſt it ſhould
raſhly be performed, &amp; leſt the <hi>Conſcience</hi> as <hi>blind</hi> as
the <hi>Will</hi> it ſelf ſhould miſguide it, it is neceſſary
that there ſhould be a certain <hi>Rule</hi> according to
which it ſhould be examined.</p>
            <p>III. In the ſecond place we are to know, that
in <hi>Rules</hi> as well as in <hi>Cauſes,</hi> there is a kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination;
And as in <hi>Cauſes</hi> that are <hi>ordinated</hi> to
one another, the latter, if compared with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
carry with them the Relation and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Effects;</hi> So in <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Meaſures</hi> ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to one another, every one of the poſterior, in
reſpect of the ſuperior, doth ſeem to be <hi>regulated,</hi>
or to be menſurated by it. Since therefore the
<hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is two fold, one <hi>next</hi> or the
<hi>immediate,</hi> and the other <hi>the firſt,</hi> and <hi>more
remote;</hi> that <hi>Rule</hi> which is next, as it is a <hi>Rule</hi> in
reſpect of the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which it doth direct, ſo
it is alſo as a <hi>Rule Regulated</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>firſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154344:66"/>
Rule</hi> by which it is it ſelf to be directed.</p>
            <p>IV. Seeing the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of every thing, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
doth conſiſt in the conformity of it to its <hi>Rule;</hi>
we are in the third place to underſtand that (as I
have ſaid) there is a two fold <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
to wit the <hi>Rule</hi> which is <hi>neereſt,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Rule</hi> which is
more <hi>remote;</hi> So there is alſo a twofold <hi>Rectitude</hi> of
<hi>Conſcience</hi> correſpondent to that two fold <hi>Rule</hi> of it;
For the <hi>Conſcience</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>upright</hi> either
<hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ſimply,</hi> or <hi>reſpectively,</hi> and <hi>ſecundum
quid</hi> as the Schoolmen do expreſſe it; In this laſt
Acceptation, a <hi>Conſcience</hi> may be ſaid to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
when it is conformable to its neareſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<hi>Rule,</hi> as he is ſaid to have a true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
knowledge of any <hi>proper paſſion,</hi> who from
the Subject of it, can demonſtrate it by <hi>its next
Cauſe,</hi> although he can aſcend no higher. But in
the former acceptation, the <hi>Conſcience</hi> may then
be ſaid to be <hi>upright,</hi> when it is not only confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
it ſelf to its <hi>next Rule,</hi> but when that <hi>Rule</hi>
is conformable alſo unto the <hi>firſt Rule;</hi> In the ſame
ſence he may be ſaid to have attained to a perfect
knowledge of any <hi>thing,</hi> who knoweth all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of it from the <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>laſt,</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
lib. 1. phiſica: <hi>Tunc enim unam quamque rem ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
dicimur, quum omnes ejus Cauſas, principia &amp;
elementa cognoſcimus, uſque ad prima.</hi> We are
then ſaid to underſtand what any thing is, when
we can give you an account of all its cauſes, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,
even to the firſt Elements thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the certainty of Science, though immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ariſing from the knowledge of the <hi>next</hi> Cauſe
doth not arrive to its ultimate perfection but by the
knowledge of the <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe, ſo the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154344:66"/>
               <hi>Conſcience</hi> though immediately it reflecteth upon a
conformity to its <hi>next rule,</hi> yet it aſcendeth higher,
and ultimately concludeth in that Rule which is the
<hi>firſt rule</hi> of it, and the ſupreme.</p>
            <p>II. In the fourth place it is to be underſtood that
when we ſpeak of the obligation of <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
that the ſaid obligation doth not ſignifie any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
(for to ſpeak properly, the <hi>Conſcience</hi> can
no more be compelled than the <hi>free-Will</hi>) but a <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
rather and authority (which ſhe is bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey)
to urge her to the performance of that which
belongs unto her duty; In the very ſame manner
altogether, as a King, who hath the Legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by enacting lawes, doth oblige his ſubjects to
the obſervation of them. As therefore in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Courts, Subjects <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to obedience, not ſo much by the <hi>law</hi> it ſelf,
as by the power of the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> (howſoever the
Law it ſelf is ſaid to oblige, but when it is ſo ſpoken,
it is to be underſtood <hi>improperly,</hi> and as it were <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially</hi>
and <hi>terminatively</hi> becauſe the <hi>obligation</hi> is
made by it, and to it, ſo the Law is ſaid to judge,
<hi>John 7. 5. Doth our Law judge any one?</hi> although
the Law it ſelf doth not judge, but the Magiſtrate,
becauſe the Magiſtrate ought to judge according to
the Law) ſo in the internal Court, the <hi>Rule</hi> or the
<hi>Law</hi> impoſed on <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth not properly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
it, but the power and authority of the <hi>Impoſer,</hi>
yet ſo, as by the Conſequent <hi>truly</hi> and not <hi>unaptly</hi>
although not ſo <hi>properly,</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> it ſelf may be ſaid
to carry with it an <hi>obliging Virtue.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is demanded, what is that which obligeth
<hi>Conſcience</hi> to the performance of her duty? At the
ſame time both theſe queſtions are propounded;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:154344:67"/>
               <hi>First</hi> and <hi>principally,</hi> who is the <hi>Lord of Conſcience,</hi>
who hath <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to impoſe a <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Law</hi>
upon it, to which it ought to conforme it ſelf? And
then <hi>ſecondly</hi> and <hi>conſequently,</hi> what is that <hi>Rule of
Conſcience,</hi> or that <hi>Law</hi> which is impoſed on it by
the Lord thereof, and to which by his dominion
and Empire over it, it is bound to conform
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>VI. In the fifth place it is to be underſtood,
when any thing is attributed to another, it is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
either <hi>by it ſelf,</hi> or <hi>not by it ſelf,</hi> that is to ſay,
<hi>by accident;</hi> Thoſe things therefore to which the
power of obliging the Conſcience is any ways
to be attributed, do fall under a threefold conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
For in the firſt place they either oblige the
Conſcience ſimply by themſelves, that is, they do <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi>
oblige <hi>by themſelves,</hi> and by their <hi>own power,</hi> not
only as <hi>the</hi> Term <hi>by it ſelf</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>the</hi> Term <hi>by
accident,</hi> but as it oppoſed alſo to this Term by <hi>another.</hi>
Or in the ſecond place they do <hi>oblige by themſelves
reſpectively,</hi> that is, as the Term <hi>by it ſelf</hi> is oppoſed
to the Term <hi>by accident,</hi> and not as it is oppoſed to
the Term <hi>per aliud,</hi> that is by another; The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is they do not oblige by <hi>their own proper power,</hi>
but by the vertue of another, having a power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige.
Or thirdly they do oblige <hi>by accident</hi> only, and
in neither of the conſiderations <hi>by it ſelf.</hi> It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
obſervable that in thoſe things which do oblige
the Conſcience in the <hi>ſecond conſideration</hi> there is
ſome difference to be made according to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
account of the cauſe from whence the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth ariſe; For it is one thing when the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is forcibly impoſed by the authority of another,
and another thing when it is willingly contracted,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:154344:67"/>
and of <hi>its own accord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this that hath been ſpoken it is manifeſt, that
there are four degrees of thoſe things which do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Conſcience; For examples ſake (to give
you a ſhort view of what hath been already ſpoken,
and of what as yet remaineth to be ſpoken) you are
to underſtand in the <hi>first place;</hi> that the expreſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Commandment of God doth oblige properly by it
ſelf, and by its own force.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, the Laws of men, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
mandates and orders of our Superiours, do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Conſcience, but by no power or authority,
but by the vertue of the Commandement of
God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Vows and promiſes being made of our
own accord, when it was wholy in our own choice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to do otherwiſe, do in their <hi>proper fact,</hi> and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of election oblige our Conſciences to the
performance of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, the Law of conſideration of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Scandal and offence doth <hi>by accident</hi> oblige the
Conſcience.</p>
            <p>VII. We are here to underſtand, that only that
obligation which conſiſteth in the <hi>firſt degree</hi> is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and univerſal,</hi> the other three are <hi>relative</hi> and
<hi>particular;</hi> I ſay it is <hi>abſolute</hi> becauſe it doth <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>alwayes</hi> oblige, and becauſe it obligeth <hi>all
perſons;</hi> and the obligation of it is never to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd.
The others may be ſaid to be <hi>relative</hi> both
becauſe they do not bind of themſelves, or by their
own power, but by a <hi>relation</hi> to ſome precept, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of God, as alſo becauſe they do not <hi>always</hi>
or <hi>every where</hi> oblige, and in every caſe, but when
thoſe conſiderations do require which they do bear
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154344:68"/>
a reference and reſpect unto. The <hi>obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the firſt degree</hi> is predominant over any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
whatſoever in the other three, inſomuch
that it is able to make them of no effect, but it is
impoſſible for them to render it fruſtrate; Nay, if we
take it univerſally, the <hi>obligation</hi> in any ſuperiour
degree, (the other being equall) is more valid
than the obligation in any inferiour degrees whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and doth judge over them, either by <hi>taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
what was done and contracted, as oftentimes,
or at leaſt by <hi>hindring</hi> what was to be done, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.
Therefore as to the <hi>power of obligation,</hi> the
Laws of men muſt give place to the Laws of God,
private contracts and promiſes to publick conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
and the Law or conſideration of offence
or <hi>ſcandal</hi> to them both.</p>
            <p>VIII. Theſe things being thus premiſed, that we
may be happy in a certain <hi>Rule</hi> by which we may
know how to live, I will according to my promiſe
comprehend in ſome few concluſions thoſe which
are moſt neceſſary to be underſtood concerning the
<hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and the <hi>paſſive obligation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt concluſion is; <hi>That God alone hath a
moſt proper and direct command on the Conſciences
of all men;</hi> So that none but God alone hath power
to impoſe a Law upon the Conſcience of any man,
to which it ought to be ſubjected, as obliging <hi>by it
ſelf,</hi> I ſay <hi>by it ſelf,</hi> for we are all bound in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
to obſerve the <hi>juſt Laws of men,</hi> to keep
our <hi>vows</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> made to God, or men, and to
be careful that we become not a <hi>ſcandal</hi> or an <hi>offence</hi>
unto others; But we are bound unto all theſe
things upon no other tye but as they are reduceable
to the will of God, commanding them as in its due
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154344:68"/>
place we ſhall give an account unto you of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
thereof.</p>
            <p>IX. This Concluſion is proved firſt by the words
of the Apoſtle already mentioned, <hi>There is but one
Law-giver, who can both ſave, and deſtroy.</hi> In which
words two arguments do prefer themſelves to our
obſervation; In the firſt place; they aſſert there is
but one Legiſlator; not <hi>one</hi> picked out amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
not <hi>one</hi> above many, but <hi>one excluſively,</hi> that is
to ſay, <hi>one,</hi> and but <hi>one only.</hi> The Apoſtle other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
had made uſe of a very uneffectual argument,
to prove what he had propounded; For he rebuketh
thoſe who unadviſedly did paſs their judgments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the perſons, or the deeds of other men, as
the invaders of their <hi>Rights.</hi> Who art thou (ſaith
he) who Doſt judge another? As if he ſhould have
ſaid, doſt thou know thy ſelf, what thou art, and
what thou doſt? It doth not belong to thee to
thruſt thy ſawcy Sicle into the harveſt of another
man, much leſs boldly to fling thy ſelf into the
Throne of Almighty God. If already thou are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it, then know, that it belongeth to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to judge of the Conſciences of men, to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
it doth belong to impoſe Laws upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of men, which none can do but God alone.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, There is but one Law-giver.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that the Apoſtle doth aſcribe unto
God alone the power of ſaving and deſtroying, from
whence we frame the ſecond Argument; He only
hath power over the Conſciences of men either for
<hi>command</hi> or <hi>prohibition,</hi> who hath power with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited
Rewards to crown the well-doers, and
with juſt puniſhments to torment the tranſgreſſors:
but it is in the power of God alone, the <hi>onely Law-giver</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:154344:69"/>
to give <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> according to
the quality of every conſcience; Therefore he
alone hath a right and privilege over the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men.</p>
            <p>X. It is thus proved again in the ſecond place;
He who alone knoweth the internal motions of the
Conſcience, he only hath the power of preſcribing
a Law unto them (for the Law doth neither deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
or judge of things unknown) But unto God
alone the ſearcher of the heart, the internal motions
of <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>Conſciences</hi> are diſcovered; Therefore
<hi>he alone</hi> hath the power of impoſing <hi>a Law</hi> upon the
Conſciences, which may oblige them. From hence
it is that the Laws of men do only bind the external
motions of the body to an external Conformity,
from the knowledge and command whereof, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
motions, and ſeveral hammers that ſtrike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the clocks of the <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to be exempted; And upon this account it
was, that not only holy men and endued with the
knowledge of the true God, ſuch as were the three
Captive young men amongſt the <hi>Babylonians</hi> in the
third of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the ſeven brethren of <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,</hi>
but many wiſe men amongſt the Heathens did
deride the threatnings and torments of Tyrants, as
exerciſing their violence not ſo much upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as upon the outſides only, and on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
of them. But let us conſider what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did think himſelf of theſe thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and what Counſels he preſcribed to his Diſciples
concerning them: <hi>Fear not them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that kill the
body, and after that have no more that they can do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, but fear him, who after he hath killed, hath
power to caſt into Hell, yea I ſay unto you fear him,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154344:69"/>
Luke</hi> 12. 3, 4. As if he ſhould have ſaid, Tyrants
by the permiſſion of God have power upon the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
but upon the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Conſciences</hi> of men they
have no <hi>power,</hi> no <hi>right</hi> at all, the Laws can neither
ordain nor afflict any puniſhment which doth belong
to the inward man; God hath only the <hi>prerogative</hi>
of the Soul and Body, and for the neglect of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
can afflict puniſhments on both, and condemn
the whole man to everlaſting torment.</p>
            <p>XI. In the third place it is proved by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and natural eſtate of the Conſcience it ſelf,
which (as before I have expreſſed) is ſo placed as it
were in the middle betwixt God, &amp; the Will of man,
as that which is uſually and truly ſpoken of <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Emperours,</hi> may as truly be verified of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of every man, <hi>Solo Deo minores eſſe, nec ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem
in terris ſuperiorem agnoſcere; They are leſſe
than God only, and on Earth do acknowledge no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.</hi>
That ſpeech of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi>
the firſt is very memorable, <hi>Conſcientiis dominari
velle, est arcem coeli invadere, To exerciſe a domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
over Conſciences, is to invade the Tower of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
He is a plunderer of the glory of God, and a
nefarious invader of the power that is due unto him,
whoſoever he is that ſhall claim a <hi>right</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of men, or practice an uſurpation over them.
Let the <hi>Biſhops of Rome,</hi> (and the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> and the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> who do flatter and cringe unto him, &amp; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
take heed that they be not guilty of this ſo
great a Sacrilege; I would alſo have thoſe admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
who do ſo ſubmit their Conſciences to the
power of any creature which ought only to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to God himſelf, to be carefull, leſt whiles
they conferre the <hi>Honour</hi> of that ſervice to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154344:70"/>
creature which is due unto God alone, they make a
God of the Creature, which <hi>at leaſt</hi> is interpreted to
be Idolatry. From this firſt Concluſion thus proved,
there followeth this <hi>remarkable poſition,</hi> That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Rule of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is that which God the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Law-giver hath preſcribed to it, and beſides
that Rule there ought no other to be admitted.</p>
            <p>XII. The ſecond Concluſion followeth, which is,
That the next and moſt <hi>immediate Rule of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
(although it be neither the <hi>Adaequate</hi> or the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Rule</hi>) is <hi>that light with which the mind at that
inſtant is endued.</hi>

is firſt proved by ſome places out of the word of
God, as <hi>Luke 12. 57. Wherefore even of your ſelves
do you not judge that which is right?</hi> They are the
words of our Saviour; as if he ſhould have ſaid, You
have <hi>the light within you</hi> infuſed into your minds
from that true light which enlightneth every man
comming into this world, by the help whereof (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
you will be wanting to your ſelves) you can
diſtinguiſh what is <hi>ſtraight</hi> from what is <hi>crooked,</hi> and
what is <hi>juſt</hi> from that which is <hi>unjuſt.</hi> The Text <hi>Rom.
2. verſe</hi> 14. and 15. is very remarkable, <hi>Quum
Gentes quae legem</hi> (ſcriptam ſcilicet) <hi>non habent,
naturâ ea quae ſunt legis faciunt,</hi> Seeing the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
who have not the Law (<hi>viz.</hi> the written
Law) do by natue perform thoſe things which
are of the Law, to wit they practice the Acts of
<hi>Juſtice, Prudence, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> and
of all other Virtues, <hi>Theſe men having not the Law
are a Law unto themſelves, for they ſhow the works of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154344:70"/>
the Law written in their hearts, their Conſciences give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
witneſſe thereunto, and their thoughts either accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
or defending them.</hi> By which words it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that in the particular Acts of <hi>Teſtifying, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi>
and <hi>defending,</hi> and in whatſoever Acts that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
are committed by any perſon, his Conſcience
doth paſſe its judgment on every one of them by
the <hi>light of Reaſon</hi> which is infuſed and imprinted
into his mind; And ſeeing the <hi>Rule</hi> is the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Acts</hi> to come, as well as concerning <hi>Acts</hi>
paſt, it followeth, that the Conſcience as well in
thoſe Acts determined to be done, as in thoſe
which are already done, doth make uſe of the ſame
light of <hi>examining, judging, and dictating,</hi> as the
Rule &amp; meaſure of thoſe Acts. I here ſhall willingly
take no notice of that Text in the fourth <hi>Pſalm</hi> and
ſixth <hi>verſe,</hi> which is commonly produced by the
Latin Fathers eſpecially of the latter <hi>times,</hi> and by
the Schoolmen, for a proof of this Concluſion, the
words are <hi>Signatum eſt ſuper nos lumen vultus tui do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
Thy light O Lord is ſigned over us,</hi> becauſe that
interpretation of the words are grounded on a bad
tranſlation, &amp; ſeemeth not to appertain to the mind
and ſcope of the Prophet.</p>
            <p>XIII. This is proved again by our common
cuſtom, and manner of ſpeech, for we uſually ſay,
that the man who acteth according to the light of
his mind, doth uſe a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
he hath <hi>committed</hi> or <hi>omitted</hi> that which
was not to be <hi>omitted</hi> or <hi>committed</hi> by him; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that he who hath not obeyed thoſe <hi>dictates</hi> of
his <hi>mind,</hi> but hath acted contrary to them, hath uſed
a bad Conſcience. St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 1
doth profeſſe, that <hi>In all things he ſerved God with a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:154344:71"/>
good Conſcience even unto that day,</hi> which words, if
they are to be extended to the former part of his
life before he was made a Chriſtian, (which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
hath been complacent to many, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
probable unto me) we may conclude by them,
that although he was an open and a dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> and as he himſelf confeſſeth, a
<hi>perſecutor</hi> and a <hi>blaſphemer,</hi> yet it may be ſaid, that
even then, in all good Conſcience he ſerved God,
becauſe in all that time he acted nothing but what
his Conſcience (according to the meaſure of that
light with which it was then endued) did preſcribe
unto him; For indeed he then thought (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
doth openly and ſincerely profeſſe in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
before King <hi>Agrippa</hi>) that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he
thought in himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that he ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> But
whatſoever may be determined of <hi>Paul</hi> and of his
Conſcience at that time, moſt certain it is, that
God himſelf gave a teſtimony to <hi>Abimeleck,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 6.</note> who ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
ſent for the wife of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he did
it, <hi>integritate cordis,</hi> in the <hi>integrity of his heart,</hi> that
is with a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> and for no other reaſon but
for this only, by which he did excuſe himſelf, for had
he known her to have been the wife of another man,
he would not have ſent for her unto his houſe. The
Conſcience therefore (by an ignorance of it ſelf
not much to be blamed, peradventure erronious)
may be ſaid to be <hi>good and right,</hi> God himſelf being
Judge, (not <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but as but <hi>ſo far,</hi> &amp;
<hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> as they ſpeak it in the Schooles) by
reaſon of the conformity which it hath with the
light of the <hi>mind thereof,</hi> as its next and immediate
<hi>Rule.</hi> But that the Conſcience may be ſaid to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154344:71"/>
right <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is fully, and in every reſpect,
there muſt another and a further Conformity be of
neceſſity added unto it, which is, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to its firſt <hi>and ſupreme Rule,</hi> which
what it is, ſhall moſt diligently be now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.</p>
            <p>XIV. This therefore ſhall be our third Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
<hi>The holy Scripture or the written word of God
is not the Adaequate Rule of Conſcience.</hi> Which in
the firſt place is thus proved; Beyond the Adaequate
Rule of any thing whatſoever, it is not neceſſary
that for the ſame thing there ſhould be any other
<hi>Rule</hi> to be added to it, for <hi>Adaequation</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the neceſſity of any Supplement: But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that there ſhould be another Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
beſides the holy Scripture, for otherwiſe the
Gentiles who have not the Scripture ſhould have
no Rule for their Conſcience, which comes quite
croſſe to reaſon, experience, and the expreſſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Apoſtle in the Text above mentioned.
Moſt certain it is, that there is a Conſcience in all
men, and that it is under a Law, which is a rule to
direct it; For as the Apoſtle maketh mention, and
it is every where extant in Hiſtory, and confirmed
by daily experience, from whence do proceed thoſe
grievous accuſations of Conſcience, thoſe whips,
thoſe pangs, and torments of the Soul, &amp; thoſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
expreſſed by the Tragedians, but from the <hi>viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Law of Conſcience?</hi> of which if there were no Law
at all, thoſe people that are moſt barbarous ſhould be
ſo much the more happy, as they are the more far
remote from the voice, and ſound of the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that then no crime of ſin could juſtly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to them, <hi>For where there is no Law, there is no
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154344:72"/>
tranſgreſſion, Rom.</hi> 4. 15. Sin being nothing elſe
but the tranſgreſſion of the Law, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4. That the power of Conſcience is
ſtrong in both regards, to fear every thing when it is
guilty, and to be in dread of nothing when it is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
is not only cryed up by the <hi>Schools,</hi> but by the
<hi>Theaters</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who notwithſtanding
knew nothing of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Chriſt, nor of the
Law or the Prophets, and never heard of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
or the Apoſtles. The Scripture therefore is not
the ſole and Adaequate Rule of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>XV. It is confirmed again in the ſecond place
from the proper end of the holy Scripture, which is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. To make us wiſe
to everlaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>g Salvation by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For
when the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>natural reaſon</hi> could not raiſe us
high enough to thoſe things which do tend to a <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
end,</hi> both becauſe of our natural light too
much obſcured and ecclipſed by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and becauſe we muſt have ſupernatural helps to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to ſupernatural ends, it pleaſed Almighty God
in pity of our infirmities, in his own word to open
his own <hi>will</hi> unto us, according to that meaſure
which he himſelf thought good, inſomuch that by
this gracious and ſaving Counſel, not only thoſe
things by divine revelation may be made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, which properly do concern our faith, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known by the <hi>light of nature,</hi> but that more
perfectly and more ſavingly we may be inſtructed
in thoſe things alſo which by nature are known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, that ſo thoſe works which nature enjoyneth
to be performed, taking their <hi>riſe</hi> from a nobler
principle, which is, <hi>the love of God,</hi> and ordained to
more noble ends, to wit <hi>the Glory of God,</hi> and the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:154344:72"/>
ſalvation of our ſouls, may from <hi>moral</hi> become <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi>
and be grateful and acceptable to God by
Chriſt. The Scripture therefore, as ſupernaturally
it is to be believed, is the only and Adaequate
Rule of our faith, and according to our actions and
performances (ſo far as they are ſpiritual, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to a ſpiritual end) it is to be the only and
<hi>Adaequate Rule of our Manners,</hi> and by conſequent
the principal, and (as I may ſo ſpeak it) the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectonical
Rule of all our actions. But ſeeing it
doth belong to Conſcience to look back on things
that are done, not only upon this account as they are
ſpiritual, that is to ſay whether they are done out of
<hi>Charity,</hi> and directed to a <hi>ſupernatural end,</hi> but as
they are <hi>moral,</hi> that is, whether they be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,
lawfull</hi> or <hi>unlawful, free</hi> or <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that a right
judgment may be paſſed on theſe things, we are not
only to ſeek unto the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> but to make
our ſeaſonable addreſſes unto other helps.</p>
            <p>XVI. In the third place this is proved again, by
the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Character,</hi> and the <hi>Temperature</hi> of
the Scripture, which ſeeing it containeth in it very
many precepts, but not all of one kind, ſome of
them pertayning to <hi>Manners,</hi> ſome to <hi>Rites,</hi> and
ſome indifferently common unto all, and ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
only to ſome Nation, and ſome again to
ſome one <hi>order</hi> or <hi>perſon;</hi> Some of them induring
only for a <hi>time,</hi> and others of <hi>a perpetual obligation,</hi>
ſome by way of Counſel, of things expedient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the exigence of the affairs requireth, and
ſome again in the way of <hi>mandate</hi> or command, of
things ſimply or abſolutely neceſſary in themſelves,
if there were not ſome other rule, beſides the
Scriptures, for the diſcerning of <hi>moral</hi> from <hi>ritual
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:154344:73"/>
precepts,</hi> and of things <hi>temporary</hi> from <hi>perpetual</hi>
and of things <hi>peculiar</hi> from <hi>common,</hi> the Conſcience
would oftentimes labour in a Labyrinth of doubts,
and know not which way to turn, eſpecially when
<hi>precepts of diverſe kinds</hi> being delivered as it were
in one &amp; the ſame breath, in the ſame Phraſe, and in
continued connexion of words, do immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and tread on the heels of one another. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
ſake, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 18. An example is there
given <hi>to love thy neigbour as thy ſelf;</hi> And in the
verſe immediately following there is a command,
that two Beaſts of a ſeveral kind might not be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to mingle in generation with one another, and
that one Field be not ſowen with diverſe ſorts of
ſeeds, nor any garment made of Linnen thread inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with Woollen. The firſt command herein
is <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>univerſal,</hi> the other but <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and
<hi>judicial,</hi> and peculiar only to the Nation of the
Jews; But when theſe things are read in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
it cannot by the Text appear what ſo great a
difference there is betwixt them; And in the 30th.
verſe of the ſame Chapter, the Sanctification of the
Sabbath, &amp; the reverence of the Sanctuary are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded, and in a continued courſe of words,
and even in the very ſame ſolemn ſanction of the
Law given, <hi>Ego Jehovah,</hi> I the Jehovah: yet I doubt
not but that moſt men are of opinion, that in one of
the Precepts the Conſciences of men are at this
day obliged to the performance of it, and that in
the other they are not. Now what the reaſon is
that their opinion is ſuch, the precepts in the Text
being all alike, and no diſtinction, nor the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence
of ſo great a difference, there can certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no other reaſon be given but that it proceedeth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154344:73"/>
from the judgment of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> which
being excluded, <hi>obligatory precepts</hi> cannot ſo be
known from thoſe which are not obligatory, but
that the Conſcience will be oftentimes in a ſuſpence,
and not able to know or judge what is commanded
to be done, or what to be left undone.</p>
            <p>XVII. It is proved in the fourth place by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
drawn from the inconvenicies which do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from the contrary opinion, that is, from the
moſt grievous calamities which have a long time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fflicted
the church of Chriſt by reaſon of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
of the <hi>perfection of the holy Scriptures,</hi>
from whence a moſt dangerous error hath poſſeſſed
ſome men of great eſtimation, that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that nothing can be lawfuly done, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
which is not authorized by God in the
Scripture, or at leaſt there approved by ſome lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
example. This foundation being once laid,
not a few men of a hot ſpirit being tranſported (<hi>to
judge charitably of them</hi>) with a zeale to God,
but not according to knowledge, did begin to raiſe
unneceſſary ſtrifes and diſputation concerning the
Ceremonies of the Church, they did declare that all
Ceremonies not expreſsly mentioned in the word
of God, were to be thruſt out, and for ever to be
baniſhed from the Church of Chriſt; that Laws or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by men concerning things Indifferent were
to be cancelled, that all the Churches throughout <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
were to be reformed, &amp; all things to be reduced
to the <hi>Evangelical purity and Simplicity.</hi> The unruly
rage of theſe men did hete for a while <hi>make a ſtand,</hi>
but it did not ſtand here long, but as commonly it
commeth to paſſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>one abſurdity being granted, a thouſand will inſue,</hi>
their boldneſſe derived from his fountain did flow
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154344:74"/>
at laſt into an open rage, and brake forth into an
Anabaptiſtical fury; And although the <hi>growing
miſchief</hi> hath gon ſo far that it can ſcarce riſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
yet every day it ſwels, and more and more
doth inlarge it ſelf by bringing into the world new
monſters of opinions, that were we not aſſured by
the word of God, that the foundation of God doth
continue firm, and that the Gates of Hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to prevail altogether againſt the
Church, it were much to be feared, leſt the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church</hi> of Chriſt overwhelmed with a Deluge
of Atheiſm, ſhould utterly be ſwallowed up by it
throughout the world.</p>
            <p>XVIII. And let no man think that in vain Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
I do complain of this, with more enuy, than
truth; for I am moſt confident, that he whoſoever
he is that is ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed and infected with
this errour, ſhall never be able in his daily contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
any ways to ſatisfie the importunate argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Anabaptiſts, Socinians,</hi> and other
<hi>Sectaries,</hi> whoſe names I am aſhamed to mention.
For to paſſe by the eſtabliſhed form of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government</hi> which now adays our <hi>Political Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
would either referr to the Civil Magiſtrate, or
quite take them away, upon no other account but
this only, that they think it is no where expreſſed in
the word of God, they muſt take away with it the
obſervation of the Lords day, the Ordination of
Miniſters of the Goſpel, the Baptiſm of Infants,
the Sprinkling of water in Baptiſm for the dipping of
the whole body, the Sacramental reverence, and
many other things, with all Eccleſiaſtical Rites,
and Laws, or elſe having reformed their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they muſt confeſſe they may all of them
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:154344:74"/>
be retained without, or ſin or ſcandal.</p>
            <p>XIX. But this, you will ſay, is to derogate from
the perfection of the Scriptures (which all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of the reformed Churches do willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge)
and to open a door to the Traditions
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to take away all the
force from the arguments drawn <hi>negatively</hi> from
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the
Church, and the moſt learned of the <hi>Divines</hi> of
theſe times do very frequently make uſe of. I
make anſwer, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth derogate
from the perfection of the Scripture in this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that in the matters of Faith, and things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſalvation, they do thruſt in their <hi>unwritten
Traditions</hi> to be received with the <hi>ſame reverence</hi> as
the written word of God, as if it were not enough
for the ſons of God, to be wiſe unto ſalvation,
by having the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> conferred on them,
which is the Inheritance left them by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but they muſt alſo have the vain books in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
of humane Traditions; But as for thoſe
who do diſpute <hi>negatively from the Scriptures,</hi>
concerning things which are neceſſary to ſalvation,
either to be believed or practiſed, let them make
uſe of this argument, as indeed they ought to do.
But there is no queſtion here of the rule of Faith,
but of the rule of Conſcience, and not of the <hi>chief</hi>
rule of it, but of the <hi>Adaequate,</hi> and not what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for a Chriſtian to believe or practice to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto the ſalvation of the Soul, but what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for a pious and prudent man to do lawfully, or
to leave undone, at <hi>ſuch a time,</hi> or in <hi>ſuch a place.</hi>
The ſum of all is, that the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> is the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate
Rule of Faith,</hi> and of things <hi>ſupernaturally to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154344:75"/>
be believed,</hi> as alſo of all <hi>moral actions</hi> ſo far as they
are ſpiritual, and ordained to a <hi>ſupernatural end,</hi> and
it is alſo the the <hi>Law of Conſcience,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Chief</hi> and
<hi>ſupreme Rule</hi> for the putting of <hi>moral things</hi> in
practice; ſo that where the Scripture determineth
of any thing univerſally, either by the way of <hi>precept</hi>
or <hi>prohibition,</hi> it is not lawfull for any other <hi>Law</hi>
whatſoever to ſtand in oppoſition to it: but it is not
ſo to be underſtood to be the only <hi>Law of Conſcience,</hi>
that what is not <hi>commanded</hi> there, to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preſently unlawfull: And thus much of the
third Concluſion.</p>
            <p>XX. The fourth followeth; <hi>The proper and
adaequate Rule of Conſcience is the will of God, in
what way ſoever it is revealed unto Men.</hi> Some call
this the <hi>Law of God,</hi> others the <hi>eternal Law,</hi> the
words differing in the <hi>ſound,</hi> but agreeing in the
<hi>ſence.</hi> Every part of this <hi>Concluſion</hi> is to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it ſelf; In the firſt place I do ſay, it is the
<hi>will of God,</hi> which by the Schoolemen (though by
ſome of them not rightly expounded, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of them not rightly applyed) is diſtinguiſhed
into <hi>Voluntatem, beneplaciti,</hi> and <hi>Voluntatem ſigni,</hi>
the <hi>will of the good pleaſure,</hi> and the <hi>will of the ſign.</hi>
The firſt called the <hi>will of the good pleaſure of God,</hi>
is that, which God from all eternity did with
himſelf reſolve what he himſelf will do; the other
which is called the <hi>will of the ſign</hi> is that by which
God hath given us a Law, by ſignifying what he
would have us to do. The firſt is called the <hi>will</hi> of
God <hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>univocally,</hi> the other <hi>improperly,</hi>
and <hi>analogically.</hi> The <hi>will of the good pleaſure,</hi> (if
it be lawfull to ſpeak of the majeſty of God after
the manner of men) is in ſome reſpect a Law unto
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:154344:75"/>
God himſelf, whereby he <hi>acteth,</hi> for he always act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that which is <hi>complacent</hi> unto him; but it is
not given to us by God to be a Law, or to be a
rule unto our Conſciences, or at the leaſt for the
putting of any thing into action; In ſome reſpect
indeed it may be ſaid to pertain unto the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
in regard of <hi>ſufferings;</hi> but this is a <hi>poſteriori,</hi>
&amp; from an after obſervation, &amp; in this ſence, that in
Conſcience we are obliged with patience to endure
all things whatſoever ſhall befall us, after that by
the event it is manifeſt to us that God would have
it ſo; For rectified reaſon doth dictate this unto us,
that we ought not to be diſpleaſed at the method
of the Divine Providence, who can will nothing but
that which is moſt righteous: It remaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Optimum eſt Deum quo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thore om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt ſine murmura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitari: Senec. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtol. 108 Placeat homini quicquid Deo placu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it. Idem Epiſt. 71.</note>
that the <hi>will</hi> be the rule of our Conſciences,
which is called, <hi>The will of the ſign;</hi> For when
God by <hi>prohibiting</hi> and by <hi>commanding</hi> hath ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what we ought to do, and what we ought not to
do, it is our duties abſolutely to conform our wills
unto his <hi>will.</hi> Many things amongſt the School-men
are with unprofitable acuteneſſe diſputed on this
Subject, <hi>viz. Whether and how far the will of the
reaſonable creature in a thing willed is bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it ſelf to the will of the Creator?</hi> When the
whole matter (as much as belongs to our buſineſs,
and the uſe of humane life) may briefly in one
word be diſpatched, which is, <hi>That we are always
bound to will that which God willeth, that we ſhould
will;</hi> Thus when God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to
offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Although God in the <hi>will of
his good pleaſure</hi> would not have had that done
which at the ſame time he commanded to be done,
as by and by ſhall appear by the event, yet <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:154344:76"/>
was bound to will the very ſame thing, becauſe
God by <hi>commanding</hi> it, did ſignifie that <hi>it was his
will that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhould have a will unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXI. I ſay ſecondly; <hi>the will of God revealed
unto Men,</hi> becauſe this <hi>revealed will</hi> is the formal
<hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the <hi>obligation;</hi> For the <hi>will of
God</hi> doth not oblige thoſe unto whom it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;
And hence it is, that the Gentiles to whom
the Goſpel is not preached, are not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, or to have any faith in Chriſt; for there
is no man that is bound to that which is impoſſible:
And it is impoſſible for that man to whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
hath been never preached, and who never hath
heard any thing of Chriſt, to believe either in
Chriſt, or in the Goſpel, ſeeing that the light of
Reaſon cannot aſcend ſo high, according to that of
the Apoſtle, Rom. 10. 15. <hi>How ſhall they believe
in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall
they hear without a Preacher?</hi> And the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
thinks it not meet, that <hi>others ſhould be judged by
the Law,</hi> but thoſe only who have <hi>ſinned in the
Law,</hi> Rom. 11. 12. Neither doth this ſuffize to
bring an obligation upon the Conſcience, that the
<hi>will of God is revealed to him,</hi> unleſſe it be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to him as the will of God, in a peculiar reference
to himſelf. Inſomuch that if any of the Gentiles
who were <hi>Aliens</hi> ſhould caſually have met with the
Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and by reading of them ſhould
obſerve the Commandements which are there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he had not preſently
been obliged to the performance of them, becauſe
they did not pertain unto him, but were only pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and it is known, that the
Law doth not oblige all men unto whom it is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154344:76"/>
known, but all thoſe only to whom it is given.</p>
            <p>XXII. In the third place I ſay, <hi>the will of God in
what way ſoever it be revealed;</hi> for the will of God
receiveth its authority from it ſelf, and not from
the manner of revealing it. So that the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in their <hi>controverſie</hi> concerning <hi>Traditions,</hi> need
not to take ſo much pains to prove That the word
of God unwritten is of equal authority with the
word of God that is written, for this we willingly
do grant unto them; We only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
how we may ſatisfie our ſelves that the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
unwritten, may appear to be the <hi>word of God,</hi>
as undoubtedly as the <hi>word</hi> which is written. The
will of God therefore in what manner ſoever it be
revealed, is the Rule of the Conſcience, provided,
it be ſo revealed, that it either actually be made
known, or may be ſo made known unto the mind,
if culpable negligence doth not hinder; And it doth
oblige the Conſcience to acknowledge it, and to
propound it unto our own will, as the will of God,
to which it is bound to conform it ſelf, and not only
ſo, but to command the <hi>executive potentiaes</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre
themſelves for the fulfilling of this will of
God. Remarkable is that of <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the Law of God

and as it were ſpurs it doth urge our Conſciences
to the performance of their duties, by repreſenting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154344:77"/>
and inculcating into our <hi>wills</hi> the <hi>will of God.</hi> And
this is that moſt proper and exact <hi>obligation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
which we before have ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>XXIII. The force and effect of this obligation is
variouſly expreſſed by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Sometimes <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
himſelf a Debator to the Grecians and Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Rom.</hi> 1. 14. As if he ſhould ſay, ſeeing I know by
<hi>the will of God</hi> that I am ſet apart to preach the
Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without difference, whether
they are Graecians, or Barbarians, I acknowledge
that in this reſpect I am a Debtor to them; And in
the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. he ſaith, that he is tyed, and bound,
as men are bound with bonds, to the performance
of this duty. And in the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the
ninth Chapter, and the ſixteenth verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
The preaching of the Goſpel is intruſted to
me, ſo that I have not the leaſure to be idle, for a
great neceſſity doth preſſe me, and wo unto me if
I ſhould neglect it. The like neceſſity to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon them, and not to be ſhaken off, was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and before St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time acknowledged by two
of the greateſt of the Apoſtles, and for a long time
<hi>individual Companions,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>John, Acts</hi>
4. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>For we cannot but ſpeak.</hi>
God hath commanded us to ſpeak with authority,
and you command us to hold our peace; Whether
it be better to obey him, or to obey you, Do you
judge? We are free, and can be ſo from your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
for you have no power upon our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
but the command of God doth hold us faſt, and
ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h ſuch a coercive power over us, that unleſſe we
wil periſh, we cannot be free, nor do any thing but
that only which he commandeth.</p>
            <p>XXIV. Moreover, when it is aſſerted, that the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154344:77"/>
next and immediate <hi>Rule of the Conſcience</hi> is <hi>the
light of the mind,</hi> and <hi>the primary and the ſupreme
Rule, is the written word of God,</hi> and the proper and
the Adaequate Rule of it, <hi>the will of God by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
whatſoever revealed,</hi> or which is to the ſame
ſence, <hi>The Law impoſed by God on the reaſonable
Creature,</hi> That theſe things may more fully be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
we are to know, that the light of the mind
is threefold, as God in three ways hath manifeſted
his will to the reaſonable Creature. There is the
<hi>light innate,</hi> the <hi>light inferred,</hi> and the <hi>light acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi>
or the <hi>light of nature,</hi> the <hi>light of Scripture,</hi>
and the <hi>light of Doctrine.</hi> The firſt light, which I
do call the light Innate, doth proceed from the
<hi>Law of nature;</hi> For in the firſt creation of the
World, as God endued brute and inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with a natural inſtinct, by which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
unto thoſe things which are congruous to
their natures, and the conſervatives of it, which is as a
<hi>Law</hi> unto them, as it is ſo expreſſed by <hi>David, Pſal.
148. 6. Thou haſt given them a Law which they may
not tranſgreſſe,</hi> So a certain <hi>natural Law</hi> is given
unto man, and proportionated to his <hi>nature,</hi> as he
is a <hi>reaſonable Creature,</hi> that is, more ſublime and
noble, and if I may ſo ſpeak it more Divine than
what is given to other Creatures of this inferiour
O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h; And this Law doth incite him to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of thoſe things which are agreeable to his
nature, as he is a man, that is to ſay, a living
Creature indued with reaſon, or to live according
to reaſon. Now this Law is natural impreſſion,
and as it were a figure of that eternal Law which is
in the mind of God, and it is a part of that <hi>Divine
Image</hi> after which man at the firſt was ſaid to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154344:78"/>
made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. by which knowing of a certainty
that there are ſome things in <hi>our reaſonable nature</hi>
that are congruous to the will of God the Creator,
and other things which are not ſo, we do conclude,
that the one is <hi>good</hi> and ought to be performed by
us, and the other <hi>evil</hi> &amp; altogether to be abhomined.
The <hi>light</hi> proceeding from this <hi>law</hi> is extremely
obſcured by that grievous ruine which folowed the
fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and from hence ariſe thoſe thick
clouds of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> in which all his poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erity
whilſt we live in this World, are invelopped.
But the <hi>providence of God</hi> hath ſo moſt wiſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

the other, This <hi>univerſal Law,</hi> though but

all the Commandements in the Decalogue are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to one <hi>Univerſal Law,</hi> to wit, the <hi>love of
God,</hi> and the <hi>love of our neighbour.</hi> To this <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Law</hi> conſerved in the <hi>Syntereſis</hi> there are other
<hi>particular Laws</hi> ſubordinated, which are derived
from it, as <hi>Concluſions</hi> are from <hi>Premiſes;</hi> ſome
whereof are of the <hi>firſt Dictate of Nature,</hi> and
next of all adjoyning to that <hi>principal Law;</hi> others
ſtand farther off, and have only a <hi>Secondary rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and by the virtue of thoſe which are more
neere. Thoſe which are of the <hi>firſt dictate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as ſoon as they are preſented to our minds
and cogitations, they preſently command our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and by reaſon of the undeniable evidence of
them, they do inforce us to aſſent unto them; for
it is not lawful to doubt of the truth of them,
nor is it poſſible for any one who underſtands the
ſence of the words, to erre concerning them; for
no ſooner it is propounded that <hi>God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped,
and no man to be injured,</hi> but the mind
preſently is at reſt, and without delay aſſenteth to
it; but in the latter, by reaſon of the difference
which may ariſe from Circumſtances, it moſt often
comes to paſſe, that we both doubt, and erre, and
the more <hi>remote</hi> we are from thoſe <hi>firſt Principles,</hi>
the more prone we are to run into error. For the
<hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>univerſal Principles,</hi> are ſo much the
more <hi>certain</hi> than the <hi>poſterior</hi> and the <hi>particular,</hi>
as they are the leſſe <hi>circumſtanced.</hi> For by <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi>
and by <hi>deſcending,</hi> as commonly it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154344:79"/>
we oftentimes do fall into errors, The precepts
of the firſt kind are, <hi>that Parents are to be honoured,
Children nurſed, the life of our neighbours to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
the pledge to be reſtored;</hi> which as they are
commonly and for the moſt part to be obſerved,
yet they are not abſolutely and ſimply if the thing
and place (which might ſo come to paſſe) ſhould
otherwiſe require it. For the Commands of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are to be deſpiſed in compariſon of the Love
of God, and there may be a juſt cauſe of diſclaym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unreclaymed Children, and taking away the life
of our neighbour, neither is the ſword to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the mad man. Near unto this diſtinction is
that diſtribution of <hi>Offices,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicer. lib. 1. Offic.</note> in <hi>Cicero,</hi> which he hath
taken from the Stoicks, for with them, <hi>a right and
perfect Duty</hi> which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
one thing, and a <hi>mean</hi> or a <hi>common duty</hi> which
the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is another. Wherefore
that the Conſcience may judge more rightly and
more certainly, what is the <hi>will of God</hi> ſo far as is
pertaining to <hi>this part</hi> of the <hi>Rule of it,</hi> it will be
requiſite to direct it to the <hi>moſt univerſal precepts</hi>
that poſſibly may be had, and to thoſe firſt Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms
which are of themſelves to be believed. But
becauſe I muſt make haſte to other obſervations, I
ſhall here put a period to my diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and preſent you with
that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his loſt books <hi>de Republica,</hi>
which by <hi>Lactantius, 6. Inſtit.</hi> 8. is expreſſely thus

nature, diffuſed into all, conſtant, everlaſting, which
calleth unto duty by commanding, and by forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
deterreth from deceit.—This Law is not
to be contradicted, neither is it lawfull for any
man to derogate from it, neither is it poſſible that
it ſhould be altogether abrogated. We cannot be
diſcharged from it either by the Senate, or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
It needs not an Expounder, or Interpreter;
It will not bear one conſtruction at <hi>Rome</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>hereafter:</hi> but being the ſame Law, perpetual, and
immortal, it includeth all Nations, and at all times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And there is as it were one common maſter, and
Soveraign Commander over all, the one God, the
Inventor, Diſcuſſor, and Communicator, of this
Law, whom whoſoever ſhall not obey, he ſhall fly
from himſelf, and be unworthy of the nature of
man; and for this alone ſhall grievouſly be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
although he eſcapeth other puniſhments that
are conceived. A remarkable place, and which ſo
cleerly unfoldeth the force and nature of this <hi>inbred
light,</hi> that we need not to make any addition to it.</p>
            <p>XXVI. <hi>The ſecond light</hi> which is conveyed into the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154344:80"/>
               <hi>mind</hi> (as I have ſaid) doth come unto it <hi>from
without,</hi> and proceedeth from <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
to wit, from that light which God hath held forth
unto us in the holy Scriptures, in which more fully
he hath made known his will unto man; that there
nothing might be wanting which is neceſſary for
the inſtitution of his manners, and the attainment
of everlaſting happineſſe. And the rather, becauſe
the <hi>inward natural light,</hi> as already I have ſhewed,
doth not ſuffice thereto. Now this light differs
from the <hi>natural light,</hi> not only in its <hi>original,</hi> but in
its <hi>perfection.</hi> Firſt, becauſe it manifeſteth the will
of God in thoſe things to which the light of Nature
cannot attain. Secondly, becauſe it ordinateth the
moral actions dictated by the light of Nature, to a
higher end; Thirdly, becauſe that whereas the Law
ingraven in the mind is inſtituted by God, as he
is the Author of Nature; This Law revealed in the
word is inſtituted by him, as he is the <hi>Author of Grace
and Salvation.</hi> Therefore where the <hi>light of nature</hi>
is either <hi>weak,</hi> or <hi>defective,</hi> as it is <hi>defective</hi> in
thoſe things which are beyond its Sphear, of which
nature are the <hi>myſteries of Faith,</hi> and weak in thoſe
things which are a little more remote from thoſe
<hi>precepts</hi> which are <hi>moſt univerſal,</hi> in thoſe caſes I
ſay we muſt have recourſe to the <hi>light of the word,</hi>
as to a light ſhining in a dark place, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19.
To the Law and the Teſtimony: if they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in
them.</hi> Ifa. 8. 20. <hi>Thy word is a Lantern unto my feet,
and a light unto my path, Pſ.</hi> 119. 105. If I ſhould
enlarge my ſelf upon the <hi>perfection</hi> and the <hi>profit</hi> of
this Law, there would be no end of my diſcourſe.
See on this Subject, the nineteenth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154344:80"/>
there you ſhall find much in few words, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely;
And the hundred and nineteenth <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
where you ſhall find the ſame things in more
words, and more largely repreſented.</p>
            <p>XXVII. Moreover, there are two parts of this
<hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> properly ſo called, and the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
I do not here underſtand the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi>
in that ſence, as for the moſt part it is taken by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
for the two Covenants made by God with
man; The covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> and the covenant
of <hi>Grace:</hi> but in the more common acceptation, for
the Books of the old and new Teſtament, which
the <hi>Fathers</hi> not unaptly for this purpoſe have called
the <hi>old Law,</hi> and the <hi>new Law;</hi> but both theſe Laws,
all the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the new Law of
Chriſt, for that part of it which containeth moral
inſtitutions, is cryed down by the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> the
<hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and other prodigious
names of a generation of people of our age, as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unprofitable, and unworthy of the care, and
ſtudy of a Chriſtian, after he is come to be of age
in Chriſt, and annoynted with the unction of the
Spirit; They will admit of no Law but only the
Law of Faith, and the Dictates of the Spirit. I am
not at leaſure now to confute them, neither indeed
is it very needfull, ſeeing that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>
hath long ſince ſo oppoſed the Monſters of ſuch
errours, as if by ſome Prophetick Spirit, he
had on purpoſe undertaken the Confutation of
them.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. The old Law, which is called the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
Law, is diſtinguiſhed into three parts, the
<hi>Moral,</hi> the <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and the <hi>Judicial;</hi> Of every
one whereof, many things are diverſely diſputed by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:154344:81"/>
many men; I ſhall at this time paſſe them by, and
briefly propound unto you what I conceive of the
obligation of them, reſerving in the mean time
to every man his own Judgment. I ſay therefore
in the firſt place, That no Law at all delivered by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> doth <hi>formally, directly,</hi> and <hi>by its ſelf</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Conſcience of Chriſtians, as it is the
Law delivered by <hi>Moſes;</hi> my reaſon is, that every
Moſaical Law, as Moſaical, was <hi>poſitive,</hi> and a
Law poſitive doth oblige none but thoſe only on
whom it is impoſed. Seeing therefore that the
Law delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> was only impoſed on the
peculiar Nation of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to any man that will obſerve but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, <hi>Hear Iſrael,</hi> and the whole Addreſſe
of the folowing diſcourſe, it cannot ſo appertain
unto thoſe who are out of the number of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as by that account to oblige them becauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by <hi>Moſes.</hi> But if any part of that Law
doth now oblige Chriſtians (as certainly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of the Decalogue are obliging) it
commeth to paſſe by Accident, and <hi>ratione mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi>
by reaſon of the matter, not becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſo commanded, but becauſe that which hath
been commanded by him is either agreeable to the
Law of Nature, or confirmed in the new Law by
Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>XXIX. I ſay in the ſecond place, That the
Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth oblige the <hi>Jewes</hi> in
their Conſciences, before the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> was preached to them, but not other men,
unleſſe thoſe only who were <hi>Proſelytes</hi> of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Religion,</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> who conſiſting of two
kinds, <hi>Proſelytae Portae,</hi> and <hi>Proſelytae Juſtitiae,</hi> ſo
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:154344:81"/>
called by the Jews, that is to ſay, <hi>Proſelytes of the
Gate,</hi> and <hi>Proſelytes of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> were obliged
to the obſervation of the <hi>Ritual precepts;</hi> Thoſe of
the former kind were obliged to the fewer, but
thoſe of the latter, as the Jews themſelves, were
obliged to the obſervation of them all. Now from
the time of the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt,
ſince the Goſpel began firſt to be preached to the
Jews, and afterwards to the Gentiles, until the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Common-wealth, this Law indeed was dead
(if we love to ſpeak after St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) but not
deadly, which is to ſay, that it had loſt the force
of obliging, but the Rites, and Ceremonies deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by <hi>Moſes</hi> were not altogether unlawful, but
left as indifferent to the obſervation of every man,
ſo that it was lawful for any one (according to
the emergency of the occaſion) to uſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his own will, and to uſe them, or not to
uſe them, a due reſpect being always had to <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
and <hi>Charity.</hi> And that this was the ſence
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is ſo manifeſt, both by his conſtant
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and his <hi>Practice,</hi> that there needeth no
proof of it. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after the everſion of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it was ſpoken by diverſe men, that this part of
the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not only <hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>mortife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;</hi>
which unleſſe it be rightly applyed, and
with a prepared <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> I am affraid will be
found to be more wittily than ſolidly expreſſed;
For all Ceremonies are not alike to be eſteemed;
But thoſe which concern <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> are
wiſely to be ſevered from thoſe which were the
Figures of Chriſt to come: for thoſe figurative Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
which were inſtituted by God, to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:154344:82"/>
Types of <hi>Chriſt our Redeemer,</hi> to come in the Fleſh,
ſuch as were <hi>Circumciſion, ſacrifices,</hi> and many ſuch
like, became certainly of no uſe after Chriſt did
really fulfill all things which were typically figured
in thoſe Ceremonies, and ſufficiently declared to
the whole world by the Preachers of his Goſpel,
that all thoſe things were rightly fulfilled, they are
therefore to be taken away, not only as dead, and
rotten, but are moſt carefully to be ſhunned by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
true Chriſtian, as deadly and peſtiferous; and
above all things it muſt moſt preciſely be taken
heed unto, that they be not obſerved with any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of neceſſity, according to that, <hi>Gal. 5. 2. I Paul
ſay unto you, if you be circumciſed, Chriſt will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
you nothing.</hi> But thoſe Ceremonies which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
only to the outward Decency, in the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Divine-worſhip, although peradventure
it were better not to uſe them where a juſt cauſe
of offence may be given, yet they are not <hi>ſimply</hi>
to be condemned as unlawfull, upon this bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that they are a part of the Moſaical pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogy.</p>
            <p>XXX. I ſay in the third place, That although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe <hi>Political Laws of
Moſes</hi> which were of a <hi>common right,</hi> of which
they aſſign ſome Notes and Critiſms, and betwixt
thoſe which were of a <hi>particular right,</hi> it is not
neceſſary that any ſuch diſtinction ſhould be made;
Nay we may roundly affirm, that thoſe Laws of
<hi>Moſes</hi> which are called <hi>Political,</hi> or <hi>Judicial,</hi> do none
of them oblige Chriſtian Magiſtrates to a ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of them, but it is lawfull for them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own diſcretion, and as they ſhall find
find it expedient for the ſafety and profit of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:154344:82"/>
Common-wealth, either to revive them into power,
or to make them of no effect.</p>
            <p>XXXI. I affirm in the fourth place, That the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law</hi> delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is to ſay, the
<hi>praecepts of the Decalogue</hi> or the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
do oblige all Chriſtians as well as Jews to
the obſervation of them; All Proteſtants that I
do know of, do with one mouth acknowledge this
truth; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore doth us the greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
who feigneth, <hi>that we do make Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to conſiſt in this,</hi> not to be bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>to be ſubjected to any Law, and that</hi> Moſes
<hi>with his Decalogue doth not pertain unto us.</hi> Let him
ſee how he can clear himſelf of <hi>this</hi> ſcandal, and
vindicate thoſe of his part from this crime, if we
are in it. For the Controverſie amongſt his School-men
is agitated, Whether Chriſtians are bound to
<hi>the praecepts of the Decalogue,</hi> only as they are the
<hi>Declaratives</hi> of the Law of Nature, or as they were
alſo delivered by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of God,
and tranſmitted into the holy Books; Some there
are of them that do deny the one, &amp; others that do
affirm both. And in our Churches the ſame diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of opinions is to be found, if it be not rather
a diverſity in words, than in opinions. For ſeeing
they amongſt themſelves, and we do agree with them
in this, which is the main of all, that the Moral Law
which is delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and is contained in
the precepts of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> hath the power to
oblige the Conſciences of Chriſtians, it will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
be not worth our labour, from whence
it doth obtain that power to oblige; In my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they ſpeak more unto the purpoſe, who ſay,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:154344:83"/>
that this Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not oblige Chriſtians
<hi>formally,</hi> and as it is delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but onely
by <hi>reaſon of the matter,</hi> as it is the <hi>Declarative</hi> of
the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> and it receiveth therefore all
its force of obliging, not from <hi>Moſes</hi> bringing or
delivering it, but from the Dictates of the <hi>Law of
Nature,</hi> which God in the firſt Creation did inſpire
into our minds, and after the Fall would have it to
remain in them, as the Remembrancer of <hi>his will.</hi>
And this may ſuffice to be ſpoken of the old Law,
or the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXII. The new Law, or the Law of Chriſt,
that is to ſay, the Goſpel, doth contain theſe three
things. 1. <hi>Myſteries of Faith</hi> to be believed, in
which chapter I comprehend the promiſes of God
by Grace. 2. <hi>Sacred Inſtitutions</hi> Ceremonial, and
Eccleſiaſtick. And 3. The Moral Precepts, of
which I ſpeak, and univerſally of all of them; <hi>That
the Goſpel obligeth none but thoſe only who are called,</hi>
thoſe only to whom it is preached. For where
there is no Law, there can be no tranſgreſſion, for
moraly, eſpecially in <hi>Supernaturals,</hi> it is the ſame
thing, <hi>Non eſſe, et non apparere,</hi> not to be, and
not to appear, or not to be ſo ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
as it may be known. The words of our
Saviour are expreſsly to this ſence, <hi>Ioh. 15. 22.
If I had not come, and ſpoken to them, they had not
had ſin,</hi> that is, they had not been guilty of deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Goſpel; But it obligeth all men to whom
it is preached to an obedience as well of <hi>Faith</hi> as of
<hi>Life,</hi> ſo that we are all bound, to whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is preached, both to <hi>believe in Chriſt as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi>
and to <hi>obey him as our Law-giver;</hi> And
whoſoever ſhall fail in the performance of theſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:154344:83"/>
two things, ſhall ſuffer everlaſting puniſhment for
the neglect of his duty.</p>
            <p>XXXIII. I ſay in the third place, That the
<hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> is obliged to the Sacred Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that is, to the preaching of the word, the
adminiſtration of the Sacraments, the Ordination
of Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the exerciſe of
the <hi>Keyes</hi> as well of <hi>Knowledg</hi> as of <hi>Power;</hi> it is
bound, I ſay, in all thoſe things which pertain to
the eſſence of them, according to the inſtitution
of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, ſo that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the Church, much leſſe for any particular
congregation, or perſon, either willingly to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
or to change any thing at all therein: But the
external circumſtances of the Sacred Inſtitution are
ſo free, that any particular Church may determine
of them according to Time and Place, and to the
cuſtome of the People of God, and as it ſhall ſeem
moſt expedient to <hi>Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXIV. In the third place I affirm, That the
<hi>Moral Precepts of the New Teſtament</hi> are the ſame,
according to their ſubſtance, with the Morals of
the Old Teſtament; and they are both of them to
be reduced to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the ten Commandements; as <hi>omnia Entia
realia,</hi> all real Beings are reduced to the ten Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments.
But the Precepts of Chriſt in the new
Law, as the holy Fathers of the Church do every
where acknowledge, are in many things far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than the Precepts of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the old Law,
not onely in that reſpect, that they are propounded
more fully and clearly, but becauſe they aſcend alſo
higher, and do advance the true Chriſtian to a more
eminent degree of perfection, and that with moſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:154344:84"/>
effectual inducements on both ſides, the paſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Chriſt being propounded to him on the
one ſide, and the ineſtimable reward to come in
the Kingdom of Heaven on the other. And this
moſt clearly may appear in thoſe two great Duties
of a Chriſtians life commanded in the new Law,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>loving our enemies,</hi> and <hi>taking up the croſs;</hi>
For as ſome have dreamed, theſe are not ſo onely
to be eſteemed, as if they were onely Counſels to a
more perfect life, propounded to all men under the
condition of a more large reward, and oblige no
man under ſin and puniſhment, but thoſe onely who
by a vow have obliged themſelves to the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them: But they expreſly in themſelves are
Precepts, and properly ſo called, and univerſally
obliging, to the obſervation whereof all thoſe who
profeſs the Name of Chriſt are bound under the
guilt of the moſt grievous ſin; to wit, the abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, and the puniſhment of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unleſs they truly do repent. And thus much
concerning <hi>the ſecond Light of the mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXV. The third remaineth, which we call the
<hi>light acquired;</hi> which ſurely is nothing elſe but an
addition or increaſe of that light (whether of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
or <hi>Revelation</hi>) which was before in the minde,
to ſome more eminent degree of clearneſs; as
when the will of God, the knowledge whereof hath
hitherto ſhined into our minds (whether internally
imprinted by the light of Nature, or externally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by the Word) or whether by our own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
or by the inſtitution of others, is now
more excellently, and more illuſtriouſly made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
unto us. The chief <hi>Helps</hi> or <hi>Mediums</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
are the <hi>Diſcourſe of Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154344:84"/>
laſt of which is the Judgement, and the Practice of
the Church; of which neither doth the time permit
to ſpeak much, neither doth it ſelf require that
many things ſhould be ſpoken of it. From <hi>the Law of
Nature</hi> many partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lar Propoſitions of things to be
done, like ſo many <hi>Concluſions</hi> from their <hi>Principles,</hi>
are deduced by the <hi>diſcourſe of Reaſon</hi> to the uſe of
the Conſcience; In which, unleſs we orderly proceed
from the firſt unto the laſt, we ſhall be apt to erre,
as already I have expreſſed; we muſt therefore be
very carefull, that in every part of the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> the
proceeding be legitimate, that thoſe things that
follow, may aptly depend upon thoſe which go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and that the conſequence be neceſſary; leſt the
Conſcience being miſ-led, do not dictate <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi>
or otherwiſe to the <hi>will</hi> than what it ought to do.
It is again to be feared, leſt we erre alſo in applying
the holy Scripture unto the uſe of the Conſcience,
unleſs a due regard of <hi>Reaſon</hi> be had unto <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
and of <hi>Authority</hi> unto <hi>Authority.</hi> The Papiſts, while
they beſtow all their ſtudies that nothing be taken
away from the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church, they give
but little unto <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The Socinians on the other
ſide, whiles rejecting all <hi>Authority,</hi> they do mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<hi>Faith</hi> by <hi>Reaſon</hi> onely, they do onely attain
unto this, that they grow <hi>mad with reaſon.</hi> Both
have the ſame errour, but it variouſly deceiveth;
And both rocks ſhall not more eaſily be avoided,
than if <hi>Authority</hi> with Reaſon, and <hi>Reaſon</hi> with
Authority ſhall handſomely and prudently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
            <p>XXXVI. What place either of them ought to
have in the right and orderly unfolding and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the holy Scripture, it is not for this time, or my
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:154344:85"/>
preſent purpoſe to repreſent unto you; I ſhall touch
upon it in few words: There is eſpecially a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in relation to the Scriptures, <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi>
and <hi>Illative; Collative,</hi> diligently to compare
thoſe divers places of Scripture, eſpecially thoſe
which ſeem to bear a remarkable correſpondence,
or repugnancy amongſt themſelves. <hi>Illative,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the words, the context and the ſcope
being found out, effectually and artificially to infer
Doctrines; being in the mean time not forgetfull
that we muſt attribute, ſo much the more, to humane
<hi>Reaſon</hi> in things to be done, than in things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
as the <hi>myſteries of Faith</hi> do more exceed the
capacity of natural underſtanding than the <hi>Offices of
Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXVII. The chiefeſt uſe of <hi>Authority</hi> is to
beat down the boldneſs of Hereticks and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
who indeavour to caſt a miſt over the cleareſt
teſtimonies of the Scripture, and to elude the force
of them with their ſubtilties and diſtinctions; whoſe
mouths you can no better ſtop, nor more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſerve your ſelves and others from the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, than by oppoſing unto their Sophiſms
and Deceits, the <hi>Judgement</hi> and Practice, not of
one, or of a few men, not of one Age, or of one
corner of the Church, but of the whole Catholick
Church, of all places, and all times, ſpread
over the whole face of the Earth; ſo heretofore
thoſe great Advocates of the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
Tertullian, Vicentius,</hi> and others; judged it to
be their ſafeſt courſe to deal with their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
by the <hi>right of preſcription;</hi> which how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
it hath been to Chriſtendome, the event
hath taught. But thoſe things which deſerve a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:154344:85"/>
conſideration, I am now forced to omit, being
mindfull of the time, of you, and of my ſelf, and
to defer unto another day what remaineth to be
ſpoken concerning the <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Humane
Laws.</hi>

the firſt place I ſhewed you that God only hath an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
abſolute and direct command over the Conſciences
of men. Secondly, that the next, and immediate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Rule of Conſcience, is the light with which the
mind at that preſent is endued, or (to ſpeak after
the Schoolmen) <hi>Ultimum judicium Intellectus pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctici;
The laſt judgment of the practical underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

               <note n="*" place="margin">4.</note> Fourthly, that the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>

fully and more diſtinctly we may underſtand what
<hi>this will of God is,</hi>) I made manifeſt unto you, that
Almighty God did lay open his <hi>Will</hi> unto mankind
by a threefold means. Firſt, by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which conſiſteth of certain practical Principles
known by themſelves, which is called the Law of
God written in our hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. Which is

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iginal as
our minds; Secondly by the written word of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
which is contained in both the volumes of the holy
Writ, and is an <hi>external light</hi> ſupernaturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and infuſed into our minds; Thirdly by a
knowledge obtained from both the former, either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
by our own meditation, or from the Inſtruction
and Inſtitution of others, and this as it were by an
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:154344:87"/>
               <hi>acquired light,</hi> the chief helps and introductions
whereunto, are the <hi>Diſcourſe of Reaſon,</hi> and the
Authority, that is to ſay, the <hi>Judgment</hi> and the
<hi>practice</hi> of the univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>II. I alſo did advertiſe you (to make ſome way
to this following Treatiſe) that beſides the Law of
God, which abſolutely by its ſelf, and by its own
peculiar power doth oblige the Conſciences of all
men, and that in the <hi>higheſt Degree,</hi> there are alſo
many others which do carry an obligation with them,
but inferiour to the former, and do oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
not <hi>primarily</hi> and by <hi>themſelves,</hi> but <hi>ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi>
and by <hi>conſequence,</hi> not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but <hi>relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
not by its <hi>own power,</hi> but by the vertue of ſome
<hi>divine precept</hi> or <hi>Inſtitution</hi> on which they are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
which although they do all agree in this, that
whatſoever power of obligation they have, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
acknowledge it as proceeding from the
Law of God; <hi>For the firſt in every kind whatſoever
it be is the cauſe of the reſt,</hi> neither would the Law of
God (as already it is ſtated) be the <hi>Adaequate
Rule of Conſcience,</hi> if it ſhould oblige any beyond it
ſelf, which it did not oblige by vertue of it ſelf;
yet theſe things (as I have ſaid) that do ſo agree
in one, do notwithſtanding every one of them differ
amongſt themſelves, not only in the <hi>Species</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the diverſity of the matter, but alſo in the
<hi>Degree</hi> according to the <hi>efficacy of the obliging;</hi> and
they chiefly conſiſt in a threefold difference, for
ſome of them do oblige <hi>conſtantly,</hi> of which there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are two kinds, The one in reference to thoſe things
whoſe obligation doth ariſe from the power of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as <hi>humane Laws,</hi> the Commandements of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Parents, Maſters,</hi> and the like; The other in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:154344:87"/>
to thoſe, whoſe obligation doth ariſe from
the free <hi>election of the will it ſelf,</hi> As Vows, Oaths,
Contracts, Promiſes and the like; Somthings again <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
do only oblige <hi>by accident</hi> and as it were curſorily,
according to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> and the exigence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumſtances, as the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon of</hi>
Scandal.</p>
            <p>The privilege and priority of order and method
do require that we begin with <hi>humane Laws,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the obligation whereof thoſe things which
at this time ſhall be ſpoken of, may all of them be
reduced to theſe two queſtions. 1. Whether <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws do oblige the Conſciences,</hi> and ſecondly,
<hi>how far they do oblige them.</hi> The determining of
moſt of the <hi>particular caſes</hi> do pertain chiefly to the
latter Queſtion, which, God willing, ſhall be the
Subject of our following Lecture, we ſhall only at
this time touch upon the firſt,<note place="margin">Delectus vim in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ponimus <hi>Cicero</hi> 1. de legibus.</note> which is, <hi>Whether
humane Laws do oblige the Conſciences.</hi> The Subject
of the queſtion needeth not any large expoſition.
<hi>Lex</hi> or the Law is firſt ſo called in an <hi>active</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<hi>a legendo,</hi> id eſt <hi>eligendo,</hi> from chooſing, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> will have it; becauſe the Lawgivers do make
choyce of thoſe things which they conceive to be
moſt profitable to the Common-wealth. Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
as others will have it, <hi>Lex,</hi> or the Law, is ſo
called <hi>a legendo,</hi> from <hi>reading,</hi> and that in a paſſive
conſtruction; becauſe the Laws after they were
Enacted were engraven in Tables of Braſſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
legibly written, and faſtned unto Pillars <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to be read in publick by the people;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquin,</hi> 1. 2. quaeſt. 90. Arti 16. <hi>Biel.</hi> 3. diſt. Arti 1.</note> Or laſtly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to other mens <hi>derivation. Lex</hi> is ſo called
<hi>a ligando</hi> that is <hi>from binding;</hi> becauſe it doth bind
the Subjects to the obſervation of it; but in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:154344:88"/>
               <hi>Genus</hi> of it, it is nothing elſe, than <hi>a Rule of acting
impoſed on the Subject by the Superiour being impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto.</hi> They are called <hi>humane Laws</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Divine; for as <hi>thoſe Laws</hi> are called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
which immediately are conſtituted by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God himſelf, whether they be Laws <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
or Laws <hi>Poſitive,</hi> ſo thoſe Laws are ſaid to
be <hi>Humane,</hi> which although they have an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
derived to them from God, yet they are <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi>
commanded by <hi>men,</hi> and impoſed on their
Subjects.</p>
            <p>III., The <hi>Law of man</hi> is thus defined by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. 1 <hi>a. 2. ae.</hi> quaeſt. 90 arti 4.</note>
It is <hi>the ordination of Reaſon to a common
good promulgated by him who hath the care of the
Commonalty.</hi> His words are, <hi>Lex humana eſt Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis
ordinatio ad Bonum Commune, ab eo qui curam
Communitatis habet promulgata.</hi> By others it is
defined otherwiſe, they differ in the words, but
almoſt all of them doe agree in the ſenſe; and well
ſo they may, for this Definition is very ſuitable to
the <hi>publick Law</hi> which is the moſt known and the
moſt uſual acceptation of that word. And ſo we uſe
to ſpeak, <hi>Analogum per ſe poſitum pro famoſiore
ſignificato praeſumitur, an Analogick being placed
by it ſelf is preſumed to ſtand for that which is the
moſt remarkable in the ſignification;</hi> But in this
preſent queſtion, and to our preſent purpoſe, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notion and Name of Humane Laws, the
<hi>publick Lawes</hi> of Cummonalties are not only to be
underſtood (although moſt chiefly they are, and
primarily) but even the particular Commands of
<hi>Parents, Maſters, Magiſtrates,</hi> and all other Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
impoſed on their Children, Servants, or
their People; for when both of them are a kind of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:154344:88"/>
               <hi>Precept,</hi> in this one thing eſpecially there is a
Difference betwixt a <hi>Law</hi> properly ſo called,
and a <hi>Mandate;</hi> for a <hi>Mandate</hi> or <hi>Command</hi> is
but the <hi>Precept</hi> of a private perſon inveſted with a
private Authority; but the <hi>Law</hi> is a publick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of a perſon indued with a publick Authority.
In all other conſiderations there is but little diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
Certainly, as to the effect, and force of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
ſince it is apparent by the tenth verſe of
this Chap. that all Legitimate Power whatſoever it
be, not only <hi>publick,</hi> (which notwithſtanding I
muſt confeſs to be the only meaning of the Apoſtle
in that place) but alſo all <hi>private power</hi> is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God, and the Command of a Father to his
Son, is no leſſe a <hi>Rule for acting,</hi> than the Law of the
Prince to his Subject; all thoſe things which I ſhall
now diſcourſe of concerning the obligation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Lawes, are ſo to be underſtood, (and let this
one premonition ſuffice) that the <hi>mandates</hi> of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons be comprehended in the <hi>publick
Lawes,</hi> and <hi>oeconomical Commands</hi> with <hi>Politick</hi>
Conſtitutions, and others of the like nature, as
far as the Courſe, and Conſideration of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
will permit. And thus much be ſpoken of
the Subject of the Queſtion: The <hi>Praedicate</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>V. The <hi>Praedicate</hi> of the Queſtion is the <hi>obligation
of the Conſcience.</hi> Now what <hi>Conſcience</hi> is, and what
is an <hi>Obligation</hi> in the generality of it, hath largely
enough been already unfolded by me, neither is
there any need of repetition; When we ſay the
Law doth oblige we mean nothing elſe than that
the Law doth impoſe on the Subject <hi>a Neceſſity</hi> of
obſerving and obeying it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:154344:89"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> You are to know that the Law of its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and as it is a <hi>Law,</hi> doth cary in it ſelf a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
force or neceſſary effect, <hi>that is,</hi> the force of
directing, from whence it is called a <hi>Canon</hi> or a
<hi>Rule,</hi> as it layes open to the Subject the will of
the Superiour, and ſheweth what it is that he
would have to be performed by him; and a power
of obliging (by which it differs from <hi>Counſel</hi> and
<hi>Admoniſhment,</hi>) becauſe it commandeth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to obey his will, and doth ſo oblige him to the
performance of it, that if he doth not obey him,
he doth ſin or erre, for Sin is nothing elſe but an
aberration or a receding from that <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Law</hi>
which we ought to follow, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
ſo Monſters by receding from the ordinary Law of
Nature, are ſaid to be the <hi>ſins of Nature.</hi> In the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecond place you are to know, that the effect of
this Law, that is <hi>the obligative power</hi> of it, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>power of the Lawgiver,</hi> ſo
that to ſpeak properly, the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf doth not
bind ſo <hi>effectually,</hi> as the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
by cauſing and inducing an obligation by the
means of the <hi>efficient Cauſe;</hi> but it may be ſaid, and
indeed uſually ſo it is, that the Law doth oblige
<hi>terminatively,</hi> that is, as a Term of obligation, and
by the vertue of an <hi>exemplar Cauſe,</hi> becauſe it is
that, to which a man is ſo obliged, that he may
work according to the Rule of it; as an Artiſt in
working is directed by the Copy that is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to him. In the third place it is to be obſerved,
that to <hi>oblige the Conſcience,</hi> is ſo to bind a man up
unto obedience under <hi>a mortal fault</hi> (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſpeak it) that if he prove diſobedient, he is
not only lyable to a <hi>temporal puniſhment,</hi> either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154344:89"/>
by the Lawes, or to be inflicted according
to the ſentence of the Magiſtrate, but he is deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
checked by his own Conſcience, as guilty of
the neglect of his <hi>Duty,</hi> and thereby of the Anger of
God contracted on him.</p>
            <p>V. The ſenſe therefore of the Queſtion is, Whether
Humane Lawes have the power to oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of thoſe men to whom they are exhibited,
in the ſame way as I have now explained; amongſt
the Proteſtants <hi>Calvin</hi> doth deny it (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
at leaſt doth object againſt him) it is denyed alſo
by <hi>Beza</hi> and many others; Amongſt the Papiſts it
is denyed by <hi>Gerſon (Bellarmin</hi> himſelf confeſſing
it) and by <hi>Almain;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellarm.</hi> 3 de laic. 9.</note> And as ſome affirm by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varrus.</hi>
Amongſt the Proteſtants again it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Muſculus, Urſine,</hi> and others; And amongſt
the Papiſts it is confirmed by the Jeſuits, and a
great number of the Schoolmen; Some there are
who do diſtinguiſh on it,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> as <hi>David Paraeus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
And it muſt needs indeed be acknowledged,
if by the heat of too much oppoſition, and the
affectation of contradiction, they had not on both
ſides erred, this controverſy had long ago been caſt
out of the world; In diſputations ſuch as theſe, I
oftentimes do call that to mind, which when I was
a young man, I did read in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>It is manifeſt that it is ſo, but not
why another doth diſpute it ſo,</hi> In which place he
diſputes, <hi>An principia ſunt contraria?</hi> Whether
Principles are contrary? <hi>An detur infinitum?</hi>
Whether there be an infiniteneſſe or not? and the
like, And therefore in theſe doubts (for this is the
true ſenſe and reading of that place in the third of
the <hi>Phyſicks</hi>) we had more need of an Arbitrator
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:154344:90"/>
(who may reconcile both opinions differing rather
in ſhew than in ſubſtance) than of a Judge, who
while he determins one part doth condemn the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
And this indeed would prevail much in a great
part of the controverſies which with ſuch contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of minds and bitterneſſe of ſtile are now amongſt
parties carried on in the Chriſtian world, if Divines
would not ſuffer themſelves to be ſwayed rather by
faction than affection. Indeed in this preſent
queſtion (as far as I can judge by the peruſal of
thoſe few books which the infirmity of my health,
and the ſtreightneſſe of my time doth permit to
look over) the height of the Spirit of contention
being on both ſides taken away, they neither
of them do ſeem to me to be in any great errour;
but I conceive that thoſe who <hi>affirmatively</hi> have
defined this queſtion (to ſpeak freely what I think)
have ſpoken more commodiouſly to the <hi>inſtitution</hi>
of our lives, &amp; more carefully &amp; ſafely to avoid the
danger of <hi>error,</hi> and more properly to the form of
<hi>ſound Doctrine,</hi> than thoſe who have defined it <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively.</hi>
But that more diſtinctly I may propoſe
unto you what I conceive is to be determined in
this queſtion, I will as briefly, and as cleerly as I
can, with ſome Concluſions comprehend and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the whole Subject; I will confim my own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
with ſome reaſons, as need ſhall require,
and I will anſwer the arguments which commonly
are alleged by the adverſe party.</p>
            <p>VII. The firſt Concluſion is, <hi>that Humane Laws if
injuſt do not oblige unto obedience;</hi> The thing is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
enough, if the words be rightly underſtood,
and that no man might give a miſunderſtanding to
them, we are to be advertiſed, that a <hi>Law</hi> may be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:154344:90"/>
ſaid to be <hi>unjuſt</hi> either in reſpect of the <hi>End,</hi> or the
<hi>Manner,</hi> or of ſome <hi>Circumſtance extrinſecal</hi> to the
<hi>Law it ſelf,</hi> or in reſpect of the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
of the <hi>Law;</hi> For it differeth, if that be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
which is manifeſtly <hi>unjuſt,</hi> or whether
<hi>that</hi> which peradventure is not otherwiſe <hi>unjuſt,</hi>
be yet unjuſtly commanded. That kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
which adhereth to the Law it ſelf, <hi>per ſe,</hi> that
is, of it ſelf in reſpect of the thing <hi>commanded</hi>
doth take away the obligation; but it taketh not
away that obligation which commeth unto it <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally,</hi>
and as it were by accident, that is to
ſay, by the fault of the Commander; For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that a Prince ſhould by a Law made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſomething to be done, the doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
of <hi>it ſelf</hi> were not unlawfull to be done; or
ſhould forbid that to be done which were not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
neceſſay; And ſuppoſe withall, there ſhould be no
ſuch juſt cauſe why he ſhould command this, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that, being induced to it either by the deſire of
filthy Lucre, or the meer Luſt of exerciſing his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or by ſome other depraved affection of his mind,
this Law is unjuſt indeed on the part of the King
that did command it, but the Subject neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
is obliged to the obedience of it. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe that Injuſtice doth hold altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the part of the <hi>party commanding,</hi> and not
of the thing commanded; So that although the
King could not without ſin make ſuch a Law, yet
the Subject without ſin could perform that which
by that Law is commanded; And whatſoever the
Subject can perform without ſin, he is bound if
commanded to perform by the Duty of obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Let the Prince himſelf look to it by what Counſel
or Intention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e inacted ſuch a Law, It doth not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:154344:91"/>
belong to me who am but his Subject to examine
it, neither ſhall it be imputed unto me if he hath
offended in it, but as long as nothing is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
but what Lawfully may be performed, it
ſhall be imputed to me if I am wanting in my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ſhall not obey him.</p>
            <p>VIII. Moreover, I add this alſo, if the Law
it ſelf either in reſpect of the <hi>Object</hi> or the <hi>Matter</hi>
be peradventure unjuſt, and grievous to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as for examples ſake, if he demands the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a greater Subſidy than the occaſion doth
require, the Conſcience of the Subject is not here
freed from the obligation; But here again we are
to diſtinguiſh; For a thing may be ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
either as it is unfit or grievous to be born, or
unlawful to be done; In the firſt Interpretation,
if it be unjuſt what by the Law is commanded, that
is if it be unequitable and not diſhoneſt, yet if it be
done, it is the fault only of him who doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it, He that obeyeth the Command is ſo far
from fault, that he ſhould be a great Tranſgreſſor
if he did not obey it; But in the latter ſenſe, if
any thing what is commanded be unjuſt, that is
not only grievous to be born, but alſo ſhamefull to
be done, and notwithſtanding it is done, the Sin
lyes heavy on both, Firſt on the Magiſtrate who
commanded an unjuſt thing, Secondly, on the
Subject, who acted an unlawful one. The ſenſe
of the Concluſion is this, Whereſoever the <hi>Law</hi> by
its Command doth <hi>forbid</hi> any thing to be done
which is ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> that it cannot be omitted by
the Subject without Sin, or whereſoever the <hi>Law</hi>
doth <hi>Command</hi> any thing to be done which is ſo
<hi>unlawful</hi> that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cannot be put in execution without
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:154344:91"/>
Sin, that <hi>Law</hi> doth not oblige in Conſcience.</p>
            <p>IX. My firſt reaſon is,<note place="margin">De jura. praelec. 2.</note> Becauſe (as elſewhere I
have fully explaned) there is <hi>no obligation for an
unlawful Act.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 13.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly (becauſe as there alſo
I have expreſſed) the <hi>firſt Obligation doth prejudge
the following;</hi> inſomuch that a new obligation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the former cannot be ſuperinduced; Now
any Law commanding a thing unlawful, as <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
Perjury, Sacrilege,</hi> or forbidding a neceſſary
duty, as the <hi>worſhip of the true God,</hi> or the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of our Dutyes to our Prince or Parents &amp;c.</hi>
doth exact that of us which is contrary to our
former obligation, by the vertue of which divine
Precept we were before obliged; therefore that
<hi>humane Law</hi> cannot induce any obligation on us;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third Reaſon is, Becauſe that no man can at the
ſame time be obliged to <hi>Contradictories,</hi> but if
that Law were obligatory, it would oblige to
the performance of that thing which the Law of
God at the ſame time doth oblige to the not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it; Now <hi>to do and not to do</hi> are Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
The fourth Reaſon is deduced from
the examples of godly men, who have been always
ſo inſtructed by the principles of their Faith, that
with a cheerfull ſpirit they have undertaken, and
performed the grievous but not diſhoneſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Emperours;</hi> But if any thing though
by the authority of Law was required of them
which was againſt <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>good manners,</hi> or any
ways repugnant to common honeſty, they openly
and couragiouſly did deny the Command, and for
the fear of God deſpiſed all humane Laws, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.
The Decree being made at <hi>Babylon,</hi>
that the concent of muſick being heard, they all
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154344:92"/>
ſhould worſhip the great golden Image which the
moſt mighty monarch had ſet up, and a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
puniſhment threatned to thoſe who ſhould do
otherwiſe, the three young men of the Hebrews
would not ſuffer themſelves to be obliged by that
Law; <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. Becauſe an unlawful thing, the
worſhiping of an Idol, was commanded. In the
<hi>Law</hi> again of the Perſians it being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that no man for certain days ſhould make a
Petition to any God or man for any thing but to the
King of Perſians only, <hi>Daniel</hi> did not obey that Law,
but as his Cuſtom was, at his ſet houres he prayed
unto God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 16. And <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being
forbidden to ſpeak any more in the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
they not only diſobeyed the Command; but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
anſwered; Whether it be right in the ſight
of God to obey you rather than God judge yee.
<hi>Acts.</hi> 4. The Reaſon indeed was, becauſe the
things that were forbidden were neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi>
The worſhip of the true God, and the preaching of
the Goſpel committed to their Chatge.</p>
            <p>X. The ſecond Concluſion. The Law of man
prohibiting a thing <hi>ſimply</hi> evil; as <hi>Theft, Adultery,
Sacrilege,</hi> or commanding a thing good and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi>
as the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, <hi>the diſcharge</hi> of
Debts, the <hi>Honour of Parents,</hi> doth induce a new
obligation in the Conſcience. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> My firſt reaſon is,
becauſe the <hi>proper Cauſe</hi> being given, the neceſſary
effect of it will follow, unleſs it be hindred by
ſome other means; But an <hi>obligation</hi> is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
an effect of the Law, that ſome have thought
that the very Name of the Law hath received its
derivation from it, as already I have men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ioned;
And nothing ſeems to be here aſſigned which may
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:154344:92"/>
hinder the conſecution of its effect. The ſecond
reaſon is a <hi>Minori ad majus,</hi> from the <hi>Leſs</hi> to the
<hi>Greater.</hi> By the confeſſion of all men, a Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
a thing otherwiſe <hi>Lawful,</hi> or commanding a
thing otherwiſe <hi>free</hi> doth oblige; therefore much
more prohibiting a <hi>thing unlawful,</hi> or commanding
a <hi>thing free.</hi> But ſomething there appears that may
be objected to both theſe reaſons, <hi>viz. Non eſſe
multiplicanda Entia ſine neceſſitate; Beings are not
to be multipled without neceſſity;</hi> For every man by
the power of the Divine Law being obliged to the
performance of what is neceſſary, and the eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what is unlawful, the ſame obligation doth
exclude that, which we think to obtain by <hi>humane
Laws,</hi> as ſuperfluous, as water praeexiſtent in a full
veſſel doth hinder the infuſion of new moyſture;
And it ſeemes that <hi>two obligations</hi> to the ſame thing
can no more be admitted in one Conſcience, than
can two <hi>Accidents</hi> of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> in one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
To this I anſwer, that it is uſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly ſpoken,
and indeed truly enough, <hi>Obligationem priorem
praejudicare poſteriori, The former obligation doth
prejudice and take place of the poſterior,</hi> which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
we our ſelves have even now made uſe of
for the confirmation of the former Concluſion;
But this <hi>Saying</hi> hath place only amongſt thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
which are Deſtructive to one another, and
whoſe effects have ſo great a Contrariety, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
amongſt themſelves, that one being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
the other of neceſſity muſt be taken away;
Notwithſtanding this doth not hinder, but that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
and a new obligation may come unto the
former, provided it be of the ſame <hi>reference,</hi> and
can be conſiſtent with it. Neither, in this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154344:93"/>
is that of any moment as is alleged of
water in a full veſſel, for the impediment why the
full veſſel admits of no more liquor, doth not
conſiſt in the part of the liquor, but proceeds from
the incapacity of the <hi>veſſel,</hi> and the nature of the
<hi>place,</hi> which cannot at once receive more bodies;
And nothing hindreth but there may be many <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> in one and the ſame <hi>Subject,</hi>
provided they be <hi>Relative</hi> and not <hi>Abſolute;</hi> as
ſuppoſe that <hi>Socrates</hi> had ten Sons, there muſt be
in <hi>Socrates</hi> ten <hi>Paternities,</hi> for relations are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
according to the multiplication of their
<hi>Terms;</hi> And we ſaid but even now, that the Law
did oblige according to the manner of the <hi>Term.</hi>
Therefore ſeeing that every Law, according to the
nature of it, and as it is a <hi>Law,</hi> is an Inductive to
an obligation, there will be ſo many obligations as
there are Lawes being correſpondent to them as to
their Terms; Neither is this <hi>Multiplicare entia ſine
neceſſitate,</hi> to multiply Beings without neceſſity, for
the cauſes being multiplied, it is neceſſary that the
effects of thoſe cauſes ſhould be multiplied alſo;
And that it may ſeem incredible to none, we may
behold it, or ſomething very like unto it, to come
to paſſe every day, both in <hi>things natural</hi> and <hi>moral;</hi>
It is evident to the ſenſe that a man may be tyed to
a Pillar with two or three cords, as <hi>Peter. Acts,</hi>
12. 6. He ſlept <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
bound with two chains; And it is to be doubted
by none, but that a man having obliged himſelf to
the performance of ſuch a duty which by the Law
of God was incumbent on him, he (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that firſt obligation) may again oblige himſelf
by <hi>Vow,</hi> or <hi>Oath,</hi> or <hi>Promiſe,</hi> to render that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154344:93"/>
the more effectual. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
vowed that <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſhould be his only God,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 21. And <hi>David</hi> ſwore that he would
keep the righteous Judgments of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.
106. And all of us who are Chriſtians, when we
were ſprinkled at the Fount, did by a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Baptiſm bind our ſelves to Faith in Chriſt,
to renounce the <hi>Devill,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi>
and to keep the commandements of God, to the
performance of all which duties moſt ſure it is that
we were obliged before.</p>
            <p>XI. The third Concluſion. <hi>Humane Lawes
(whether things unlawful, or neceſſary, or things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
be commanded) being made by a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or by a Commonalty not having a lawful power, do
not oblige in Conſcience.</hi> As if the Mayor of this
City ſhould impoſe Laws on this Univerſity, or my
next Neighbour ſhould command my ſervant to
yoak my Oxen to bring in his harveſt, &amp;c. Or as if a
company of ſeditious Perſons being met in ſome
one County of <hi>England</hi> (as they did heretofore
under the conduct of <hi>Ket</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and many
times in other places) ſhould demand of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
a certain Sum of money, or ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Edicts to exact a ſervitude of their perſons not
due unto them, and by force of Armes ſhould
compel them to obedience, although it peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were lawful for them to do as they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
(it being found they were unable to make
reſiſtance) yet certainly their commands ſhould
oblige no man in Conſcience to the obſervation of
them;<note place="margin">Aquin. 1. 2. quaest. 96. art. 4.</note> Firſt, becauſe the ſaid Laws are Laws only
in name, and <hi>aequivocally;</hi> But in deed, and in
earneſt they are rather <hi>violences</hi> than <hi>Laws,</hi> and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154344:94"/>
an <hi>aequivocal Cauſe</hi> doth inferr no effect; as a
ſentence ſpoken by one who is no <hi>Judge</hi> doth not
oblige the Parties; And Secondly, Becauſe the
Power of obliging (as already hath been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
is not <hi>effectively</hi> derived from the Law it
ſelf, but from a will joyning with the power of
the Law-maker; therefore where <hi>Power</hi> is wanting,
the <hi>Cauſe</hi> that is properly the efficient of that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is wanting alſo, and the <hi>proper Cauſe</hi> being
defective, it is neceſſary that its <hi>Effect</hi> ſhould be
deficient alſo; And this is eaſie to be collected by
the words of the Apoſtle in this place, who dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the Duty of obedience on the part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
from the Power of Juriſdiction in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
from whence it is, no man is bound to <hi>obey</hi>
him who hath not the Right of <hi>Commanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XII. If you ſhall object, that an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of factious perſons, ſuch as before I have made
mention of, have the <hi>Power of Commanding,</hi> becauſe
they can compel thoſe to the performance of their
commands, over whom they exerciſe their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
I anſwer that the <hi>Power</hi> of which I ſpeak, and
on which <hi>Obligation</hi> doth depend, is not that Power
which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is <hi>Might</hi>
or <hi>Puiſſance</hi> (which by moſt is uſed in this ſenſe)
by which a man is potent to give ſuch an effect to
his Intention that it <hi>finally</hi> cannot be hindered, but
that Power, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that
is a lawful Power, which cometh by ſome Right of
<hi>Nature,</hi> or of <hi>Nations,</hi> or by a <hi>Civil Right,</hi> in reſpect
both of the perſon who bears it, and of thoſe who
are any wayes ſubſtituted under him. This Power
in this preſent Argument the Apoſtle doth ſo much
preſſe, that in the ſpace almoſt of three Verſes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:154344:94"/>
he names it five times, and makes not the leaſt
mention of the other.</p>
            <p>XIII. But you will allege, that thoſe, who in the
time of the Apoſtles were the ſupreme Governors,
did aſcend unto the height of the Empire, not by
any Right of Inheritance, nor by the free Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the people, or any lawful Authority, but
by Force and Treachery, or military Tumult, and
yet the Apoſtle notwithſtanding doth expreſſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is a lawful Authority to
them, as unto legitimate Magiſtrates, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
on their Subjects a neceſſity of obeying them,
and that not for <hi>fear of Puniſhment,</hi> but for <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſake.</hi> We muſt confeſſe indeed, that the firſt
Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the everſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
did not attain unto the Empire by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great lawfulneſſe of Right, yet withall we muſt
confeſs, that they were inveſted with the <hi>Right of
the Sword,</hi> and a legitimate Juriſdiction, to which all
whoſoever were under the Roman Power ought to
be ſubject, for there was not then any ſingle perſon
that could challenge it as due unto him by more
Right, and the <hi>Senate, and People of Rome</hi> in whoſe
Power not long before, and for many Ages alſo
was the chief Command, what by fear, and what
by obſequiouſneſs, did give way to the loſſe of their
Privileges, and acknowledged thoſe for their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Princes, who had obtained the Empire by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Acts. This being granted, which certainly
in my opinion can no wayes be denyed, there can
remain no other doubt concerning the <hi>neceſſity of
obeying.</hi> But in a dubious caſe, what is the duty
of a Chriſtian, whether and how far he is obliged
in the <hi>Court of Conſcience</hi> to give way unto the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:154344:95"/>
Times, and to accommodate himſelf to the preſent
manners, and be obedient to the Lawes, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts,
and the Commands of one who in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at leaſt hath attained to the Soveraignty <hi>de
facto,</hi> that is by Power and by no Right at all, it is
no eaſy thing to judge, neither is it the part of a
wiſe man to determine any thing on ſo great, and
ſo high a Point.</p>
            <p>XIV. I here therefore do conclude on nothing
poſitively; but that I may not be cenſured to be
wanting in my duty, or at leaſt to your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if I ſhould make mention of a Queſtion, and
give you not the leaſt ſatisfaction in it, I will in a
a few words expound unto you what ſeemeth to
me (having been very ſerious hereupon) to be
moſt conſentaneous to true reaſon, unleſs perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
ſome circumſtances, as oftentimes it
comes about in ſuch deliberations, ſhall grow too
much upon my Judgment. In the firſt place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſay, That he who <hi>de facto</hi> is chief Magiſtrate
in a City, or Nation, although he hath attained to
that power by evil Arts, is neverthheleſs to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
by the Citizen as his lawful Prince, and
by the obligation of his Conſcience he is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
bound to obey him, provided there be no
juſt cauſe of any doubt to the contrary; And in
this caſe, this ſeems to be the only and juſt
<hi>cauſe</hi> of doubt, when moſt certainly it is manifeſt,
or at leaſt when it ſeems very probable to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen,
that there is ſome other perſon to whom <hi>the
chief power</hi> is due by <hi>greater right.</hi> If this be not ſo,
the Citizen cannot in a good Conſcience refuſe
the commands of the preſent <hi>Poſſeſſor;</hi> For ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
it doth not belong unto a Citizen too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:154344:95"/>
to enquire by what right the poſſeſſor doth
poſſeſſe, it may ſuffice him for the ſecurity of his
Conſcience that he doth poſſeſſe <hi>de facto,</hi> and there
is no other man, at leaſt ſo far as he knows, who
ought by right to poſſeſſe that place; And beſides
that which I have already ſpoken concerning the
Roman Emperors, the Government of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
being ſubverted; to this the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
almoſt of all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth pertain,
many of whom relyiug not ſo much as on the leaſt
ſhaddow of Right, but having obtained the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by unjuſt Arms, and nefarious wickedneſſe
(the Royal off-ſpring of their Predeceſſors being
utterly extinguiſhed, that not one of them might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to ſucceed in their Fathers Dignities) did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
the Royal Throne, and governed the Kingdom,
by a full and as it were a proper Power, and the
people rendred obedience to them no otherwiſe
than if they had been inveſted in it by the greateſt
right; Neither do we find that the people were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
blamed for it, But right reaſon rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that it ſo ought to be done; For it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the publick ſafety, that there ſhould be one
who ſhould ſit at the Helm of Government,
and it could not otherwiſe be better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the affairs of his people, and himſelf,
than that he ſhould be eſteemed to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
right, who as a true poſſeſſor had no right at all;
And by the Law of Nations, thoſe things which
belong to none, do paſſe into the right of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
poſſeſſors of them.</p>
            <p>XV. In the ſecond place I ſay, That in an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Kingdom, where the right is doubtful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two or more <hi>Competitors,</hi> it is the part of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:154344:96"/>
a good Citizen whiles the contention is yet depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and the right to be deſcerned by a friendly
treaty, or by war, to obey him as his lawful
Prince who is in preſent poſſeſſion of the Soveraign
command. Of this Hiſtories can every where
afford us very many examples; amongſt thoſe
which are moſt remarkable, are the many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which happened amongſt the competitors of
the Kingdom of <hi>Portugall</hi> after the death of King
<hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> And the ſix conteſtations at leaſt for
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> after the death of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the King; And the moſt fierce and laſting
contention for the Government of the Engliſh
Nation between the moſt noble families of <hi>York</hi>
and <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> Moſt certain it is, by the conſent
of all nations throughout the world, that the Law
did alwayes favour the Perſon poſſeſſing; And in
theſe Caſes that remarkable ſaying of the Civilians
always prevailed, <hi>In rebus dubiis melior eſt conditio
poſſidentis,</hi> In doubtful things the condition of the
Poſſeſſor is always the better.</p>
            <p>XVI. But again, the lawful Prince and Heir
of the Kingdom being forced away by the Power
of Arms, or being ſo oppreſſed that he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
his own Right, If any perſon whatſoever
(the ſaid Prince yet living) ſhall violently take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own hands the Reigns of Government, and
deport himſelf as a King, when he is more truly an
Uſurper, ſo that now it is no longer a <hi>doubtful right,</hi>
but an <hi>open injury;</hi> If you demand of me what a
good Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>zen ſhall do in this condition, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
hath taken the Oath of Allegiance in the
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of his lawfull Prince, or if he hath not, yet
he is no leſſe indutyed to him, than if he had taken
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154344:96"/>
it, I ſay in the third place, that a good Citizen
may not only lawfuly obey the Laws of him who
Governs <hi>de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de jure,</hi> that is, <hi>by
preſent power,</hi> and not <hi>by right,</hi> and perform all his
commands (provided there be nothing in them
that is <hi>uniuſt,</hi> or <hi>foul,</hi>) but according to the
condition of humane affairs, there may be ſuch an
exigence of neceſſity (as oftentimes it ſo comes to
paſſe) that he may be adjudged to fail even in his
duty, if he doth not do it. It may be objected,
that but even now it was ſaid, <hi>that Laws made by
one who hath no lawful power do not oblige in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi>
It was ſo ſaid indeed, and it was truly
ſaid ſo, and I believe what I have now propoſed is
not repugnant to it; For ſuppoſe that a Subject be
obliged to perform what by the Law is forbidden,
yet he is not bound to the <hi>Law,</hi> but to <hi>himſelf</hi>
and to his Country. The obligation is annexed to
that Law which is <hi>truly ſo of it ſelf,</hi> &amp; as it is a <hi>Law,</hi>
and it neceſſarily followeth it, as the Effect follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
its Cauſe. We have already ſaid, that a Law
made by one who hath no <hi>right</hi> unto the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not a Law <hi>properly</hi> but <hi>aequivocally,</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath no power to oblige; Therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
obligation doth from hence appear to charge
the Conſcience of the Subject, doth ariſe from
another account, and not from the Law it ſelf
to whom this obligation comes <hi>extrinſecally</hi> and
only by accident, as if a profeſſor of Muſick
ſhould act the part of a Maſon.</p>
            <p>XVII. You will demand, If not from the Law,
from whence then proceedeth this obligation of
the Subject? I anſwer; It being the part of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and prudent man, not only to attend on that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154344:97"/>
which is lawful, but alſo to obſerve what becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelf, and is expedient for others; A good
Citizen may be obliged to do that for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of himſelf, and his fellow-Citizens, to the
performance whereof he is not upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
or by any right obliged. For this obligation
doth ariſe from that double part of duty, by which
every man is a debtor to himſelf, and a debtor to
his Country; In the firſt place it belongs to a <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man</hi> to provide for himſelf, and for his own
affairs, and it belongs to an <hi>honeſt man</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in what preſent condition he is; For no man
will deny, even by the Dictates of Nature, but that
all muſt endeavour by all lawful ways and means, to
defend their lively-hood, and themſelves, and ſo
to deport themſelves, that they may live ſafely, and
in peace, to have and to hold to themſelves their
own Fields, Houſes, and poſſeſſions, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not to offend thoſe who at their pleaſure can
take from them both their lives and their fortunes;
And from hence is the firſt neceſſity of obedience,
which our Apoſtle therefore doth not ſo much urge
as ſuppoſe, becauſe that every man is endued with
the ſenſe thereof by Nature;<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>not only for wrath,</hi> as if it were not the part of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
man raſhly to provoke his wrath who hath
the power of the Sword in his own hand, and by
his contumacy to incurre his diſpleaſure upon no
occaſion; It ſhould become him for the advantage
of his own ſafety, to endure many affronts, to obey
Laws, and as much as can be without Sin, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to ſubmit to the preſent
powers; and thus, though he cannot ſhake off the
yoak, yet by well enduring it, to make it more
gentle, and more eaſy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:154344:97"/>
XVIII. But he whoſoever he is who from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Government ſhall diligently obſerve with
himſelf what good from thence may be derived to
his Country, ſhall find himſelf bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this, with another, and a ſtronger
obligation, and which more properly pertaineth
to the Conſcience; and ſo indeed St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>

               </gap>, as if the Apoſtle

protection which a Civil Government conveyeth
to the Subject; As if he ſhould have ſaid, Seeing
that every Citizen is conſcious to himſelf how
many benefits he doth enjoy under a <hi>politick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
he muſt know, that for the requital of ſo
many and ſo great favours, he is bound by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

who is inveſted with the higheſt Authority, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,

<hi>Raro fieri ut quis imperium flagitio quaeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

               </gap>aketh in the fourth verſe of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for there cannot be ſo great a Tyranny which
doth not retain ſome ſhew of a juſt Government,
and doth not, at leaſt a little, conduce to maintain the
ſociety of men, as <hi>Calvin</hi> rightly on this Text ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
it. Seeing therefore that we are Maſters of
our own Eſtates, and do live ſafe from ſlaughter, and
rapine, &amp; ſeeing that even that we live is a Debt
we do owe to the chief Powers (without which
there would be no defence or remedy againſt the
luſts, fury, and injuries of wicked perſons) a moſt
reaſonable and righteous thing it is, that at leaſt
we ſhould return ſomthing for ſo many benefits.
The old form of Trafficking (an excellent Law of
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>right</hi>) doth exact the ſame of us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Give ſomething, and take ſomething;</hi>
And certainly it argueth a moſt perverſe mind, to
be willing to live under the protection of his
Government whom you are unwilling to obey, and
to refuſe his commands, under the umbrage of
whoſe patronage you do find your ſafety.</p>
            <p>XIX. Moreover, ſince no man is born only for
himſelf, but for publick profit, and for mankind in
general, there ariſeth from hence a third neceſſity
of obeying the <hi>preſent power,</hi> although it hath been
procured by never ſuch indirect means. From
hence alſo it may in ſome manner appear what
meaſure, and what bounds are to be given to that
obedience which by the duty of Conſcience is to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:154344:98"/>
be given to him who uniuſtly ſits in the
throne of ſupremacy; For whatſoever is to be
done in a peculiar reference to its end, ought ſo
to be done, as ſhall appear moſt neceſſary and
profitable for the obtaining of that end; Now the
end of Civil Government and of the obedience due
unto it, is the tranquillity and ſafety of Humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
As far therefore as the peace and ſafety of
that ſociety of which that Citizen is a Member
doth require, ſo far he is bound to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of that perſon, who <hi>de facto</hi> is the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
in that ſociety. Now for the preſervation
of Humane ſocieties there are three things very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
The firſt, <hi>the defence of our Country</hi> againſt
all Forein force, and endeavours of our Enemies.
Secondly, <hi>the adminiſtration of right,</hi> that due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
may be given to deſerving Citizens, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
to the bad which is the office of <hi>diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Juſtice.</hi> Thirdly, the care of Commerce, and
Merchandize, concerning buying, ſelling, exchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all manner of contracts, which belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Juſtice Commutative;</hi> In theſe three the ſafety
of mankind is ſo contained, that unleſs they be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
it cannot be but all things preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will run to ruine, all things and all places
will be filled with Plunder, Slaughter, Deceit and
Injuries, the lives of the moſt innocent Citizens,
their Wives and Fortunes will become a prey, and a
ſport unto the luſts of our armed Superiours; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
which calamity, and that the petulancy of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men may timely be reſtrained, the only remedy
is for good Citizens to remember that it belongs
unto them in all things pertaining to the publick
ſafety, to be obedient to their Laws, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154344:99"/>
by whoſe Sword, &amp; authority they are defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the injuries &amp; the violence of the Spoylers.</p>
            <p>XX. But that no man may give a falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to what here is ſpoken, they are to pay only
ſuch an obedience, that at the ſame time they are to
remember, that they are no further obliged to it,
than either the account of gratitude, or the ſafety
of the publick do require; And the Laws of an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
are to be obſerved, not as obligatory by any right
of the Commander,<note place="margin">1. a 2. ae. quaeſt. 96. art. 4.</note> but as <hi>Aquinas</hi> rightly hath it, to
<hi>avoid offence,</hi> and the <hi>trouble of the Common-wealth.</hi>
In which caſe he ſaith we ought to depart from our
own right, and he proves it out of the words of
Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 5. 40, 41. Ei qui vult tecum liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare,
et tunicam tuam capere, dimitte et pallium, Et
qui te angariabit ad miliare unum, abi cum eo duo,
If any man will ſue thee at the Law, and take away
thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo; And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhall compell thee to go a mile, go with him
twayn.</hi> A man therefore may, and if occaſion ſo
requires, he ought to depart from his own right
for his own peace, but much more for the publick
tranquillity, and obey him who hath no lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to command; But above all he muſt have this
Reſerve, ſo to depart from his own right, that by
ſo doing, he taketh not any thing away from the
right of another; And <hi>Abraham</hi> in this did juſtly
and wiſely, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. who though he made the King of
<hi>Sodom</hi> partaker of the ſpoils which by the right of
war was his portion from the five Kings that were
overthrown, yet he cautelouſly provided, that
both the Prieſt ſhould have his <hi>Tenths,</hi> and his
three Aſſociates in the War ſhould not want of their
full proportions. In the like manner obedience is
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154344:99"/>
ſo to be payed to an Uſurper, that the fidelity due
unto the lawful Heir be no ways violated, and that
<hi>his right</hi> ſuffers no prejudice by it.</p>
            <p>XXI. But it may be objected; How can this be
done? That which is grateful to an Uſurper cannot
but be moſt ungrateful to the lawful Prince? No
man can ſerve two Maſters that look ſo contrary,
all whoſe Votes,<note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Studies and Counſels are violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carryed on to the ruine and deſtruction of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
I anſwer, the account being well compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there is no reaſon that we ſhould think that
this obſequiouſneſs of the Citizen, ſo ordered, and
bounded, as we before have delivered, ſhould be
unpleaſing to the lawful Prince, but altogether to
the U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urper; nay we may preſume that with the
conſent of the true Prince himſelf, it ought to be
ſo; For by this obedience the Citizen is not to be
accounted to have aſſiſted ſo much the unjuſt Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
as the whole Commonalty, or Republick,
the ſafety whereof doth no leſſe concen the
true Heir, than the unjuſt Poſſeſſor: Nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
much more; becauſe being the true
Father of his Country he is to be believed to
love it ſincerely, &amp; to wiſh it more happineſſe, than
the other, who (having excluded him) hath thruſt
himſelf into his houſe, and hath excerciſed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over his Family; and by how much the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Mother to her Children are more pure, &amp;
vehement, than a Step-mothers, as may appear
by that remarkable conteſtation of the two Harlots
before <hi>Solomon,</hi> the true Mother who knew the
Child to be her own deſiring the ſafety of it, and
that it ſhould be given rather to another, nay, unto
her Adverſary, than that it ſhould periſh by the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154344:100"/>
Sword; ſo it is moſt likely, and it is to be preſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the lawful Heir hath a greater care of the ſafety
of his people (whom although for the preſent under
the yoak of a Stranger, yet he doth acknowledge them
to be his own, &amp; hopeth well that in time they will
prove profitable to him) than he who having newly
uſurped the ſupreme Magiſtracy will be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it is likely, to eſtabliſh his newly acquired Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
than to procure the ſafety of the publick, and
therefore the lawful Heir had rather that as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
as they could they ſhould accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the preſent affairs for their own ſafety,
than to run into a certain deſtruction, by making an
unſeaſonable, and an unſucceſsful oppoſition againſt
one that overpowers them. And thus I have given
you my opinion concerning this moſt difficult and
high queſtion, determining <hi>poſſitively</hi> of nothing,
but being ready, if any man ſhall render more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
reaſons, to correct what hath been ſpoken, and
to jump in to the ſame Judgment with him.</p>
            <p>XXII. The fourth Concluſion followeth, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws concerning things not unlawful, do by
themſelves, and directly, in the general oblige the
Conſcience.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
precept, that Subjects ſhould obey humane
Laws being duly made, is <hi>obligatory directly and by
its ſelf;</hi> And this <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, who doth not
uſe to attribute too much to humane conſtitutions,
doth acknowledge, who in the 4 Inſtitute, 10. §. 5.
doth adviſe that ſuch a diſtinction be made <hi>inter
Genus et Speciem,</hi> betwixt the <hi>General,</hi> and the
<hi>Special,</hi> that although it be denied that Laws in
the <hi>Special</hi> do oblige the Conſcience, yet it muſt
be granted, that they have an obliging power in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154344:100"/>
               <hi>General.</hi> The reaſon is perſpicuous, for this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
precept doth pertain to the eternal and Divine
Law, every part whereof doth <hi>directly,</hi> and by it
<hi>ſelf,</hi> and not only by <hi>conſequence,</hi> oblige our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
It pertains to the Law of God in a double

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the general Divine Commandment.</hi> I ſay in
the firſt place <hi>Lawes ſolemnly and rightly conſtituted,</hi>
that is, both by reaſon of the <hi>efficient Cauſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made by him, who is indued with lawful Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and by reaſon <hi>of the matter,</hi> commanding nothing
unlawful, diſhoneſt, or filthy, or any wayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the Duty of a Chriſtian; For we already
have aſſerted, that the Lawes which do offend in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe two ſenſes, are not obligatory. I
ſay in the ſecond place, <hi>In the particular,</hi> that is, to
a particular Determination, <hi>in things</hi> of a middle
Nature, and in others; As what, and how much tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
is to be paid; What merchandiſe is lawful, and
what unlawful to be exported or to be imported in
ſuch and ſuch a Country; What habits are ſuitable
to ſuch and ſuch degrees in an Univerſity; What
Statutes are diſpenſable, and what not, &amp;c. I ſay
in the third place, that ſuch Lawes doe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
by themſelves, and directly; I prove firſt
becauſe, that God alone is that Law-maker,
who hath a moſt peculiar and direct Command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Conſciences of men. <hi>There is but one Law-giver,
who is able to ſave and deſtroy, James</hi> 4. 12.
In things of a middle nature, &amp; which are indifferent
(which for the moſt part are the ſubjects of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws) we do ſuppoſe that God made no Law
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:154344:101"/>
in <hi>particular,</hi> but left them all to the arbitration of
thoſe who are his Vice-gerents on Earth. It is
proved thus in the ſecond place, becauſe that thoſe
things only do oblige <hi>directly, and by themſelves,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
which oblige by reaſon of the <hi>matter</hi> as of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Cauſe, without any reſpect to the external
Cauſes, the <hi>Efficient</hi> and the <hi>Final,</hi> which would
have obliged of themſelves, if they had not been
commanded by Men; But things indifferent, and of
a middle Nature, determined by a particular and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
humane Law, when they are ſo qualified in
themſelves, that before the Determination of
them, they may freely be made, or nor be made
by any, they doe not oblige in reſpect of the <hi>matter,</hi>
therefore <hi>not of themſelves.</hi> I ſay in the third place,
that the ſame Lawes notwithſtanding doe oblige in
particular by the <hi>Conſequent</hi> and by Vertue of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>general Divine Commandement;</hi> And becauſe in
this laſt poſition, the hindge of the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
is turned, I will more plainly propound the
Concluſion, which by and by I will more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm;
The Concluſion is this, <hi>Poſitive humane
Laws</hi> being rightly and lawfully conſtituted, which
contain particular determinations concerning things
of a middle Nature and in themſelves indifferent,
and which before they are determined are free to
be made, or to be unmade, do by the vertue of
of the Divine Commandement (by which we are
bound to obey thoſe who are ſet over us by God) ſo
oblige the Conſciences of the Subjects to perform o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to them, that they are bound under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ings of their accuſing Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences.</p>
            <p>XXIV. This Concluſion is confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Reaſons, the firſt whereof is taken from this
preſent Text, <hi>we muſt therefore be ſubjected, not only
for wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> The words in
themſelves are perſpicuous enough; In the former
verſes the Apoſtle had largely inſiſted upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of <hi>Chriſtian Subjection,</hi> which he urged chiefly
by two Arguments, the one from the Inſtitution,
and the Ordination of God, in the two firſt verſes,
and the other from the fear of the Puniſhment of
man, in the two verſes following; In the way of
recapitulation he briefly recollecteth either Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and repeateth them in this fifth verſe, and
(as it is very uſual in the Scripture) in an <hi>order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi>
beginning the repetition from the latter,
and the next member; As if he ſhould have ſaid, A
great neceſſity of Obedience doth lye upon you in
both reſpects, whether the fear of puniſhment
may deterr you, or the Conſcience of the Duty
may incite you; If you deſpiſe the Power and
Authority of the Lawes, and do evil, conſider with
your ſelves, that the Magiſtrate who is ſet over you
is the Miniſter of God, the Revenger of your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
Duty, and ready to draw the Sword
(with which God hath intruſted him) to inflict a
corporal puniſhment due to the deſpiſers of his
Lawes. But if theſe things move you not, being
deluded by a vain hope to find out one ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
or another to eſcape the force of his Arm, yet
think on God the juſt Remembrancer of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Acts
committed, whether they be good or evil, ſtand in
awe of him as of a juſt Judge, Fear your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
thoſe ſevere accuſers, thoſe faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:154344:102"/>
and importunate Tormentors; you cannot
avoid them by any Artifices, not elude them by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Inventions. From the ſcope of this place, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is thus framed; Thoſe things, which being
violated, do leave a Remorſe upon the Conſcience,
do oblige the Conſcience, for ſo it muſt neceſſarily
be, that all remorſe or reproof of Conſcience
muſt proceed from the ſenſe of ſome obligation, as
all other effects do follow their cauſes; but humane
Laws being violated, do leave a remorſe upon the
Conſcience, for that is the expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e ſenſe of thoſe
words in the Text, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ſubjici propter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiam,
You muſt of neceſſity be ſubject for
Conſcience ſake,</hi> you cannot keep your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upright, and ſafe, unleſſe you be ſubjected;
Therefore humane Laws do oblige the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>XXV. But ſome there are who to un-nerve the
force of this Argument, do in this place give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Interpretation unto <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and chiefly
herein they defend themſelves by the Authority of
<hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> as if no, other Conſcience was to be
underſtood in this place, but a Conſcience only of
benefits which is derived unto Subjects from the
<hi>Political Government;</hi> I have made mention of this
heretofore, and prayſed it; for the ſenſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
is pious, though not ſo genuine; And I have
thus much againſt it; For in the firſt place amongſt
the Ancients <hi>Chyſoſtome</hi> is ſingular in this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
whom hardly one or two amongſt ſo many
Interpreters have followed, <hi>Theophy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>act</hi> only, and
<hi>Oecumenius</hi> excepted, Who are not to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the number of witneſſes, for they ſo tread
in the footſteps of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that all three of
them do make only but one witneſſe. Secondly,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:154344:103"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> No place can be aleged in the Scripture, in which
either St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other of the Apoſtles have
made uſe of the word Conſcience, in that ſenſe as
<hi>Chryſostome</hi> here doth feign unto himſelf. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Apoſtle in this place (as it is very manifeſt)
would induce ſomething which ſhould be of more
moment, and more effectual to ſtir up the minds of
men than <hi>temporal puniſhment;</hi> for which end it was
better to affright them with the fear of the Divine
anger, than to admoniſh them of any benefits receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from men. Fourthly and laſtly, the Apoſtle here in
a ſhort repetition of thoſe reaſons before alleged,
would conclude his diſcourſe of Chriſtian Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
now in the two firſt Verſes of this Chapter
he did bring the reaſon, not from the <hi>Conſcience of
the benefit,</hi> but of <hi>the duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXVI. The ſecond reaſon followeth, from the
<hi>uſe</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> of the Laws; It being moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that they ſhould be made and obſerved, for the
preſervation of humane ſocieties in peace, and
publick tranquillity, for otherwiſe there would be
no certain <hi>rule</hi> of Contracts, no <hi>meaſure</hi> of Faith,
and Civil Juſtice, which are the firmeſt bands of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſocieties; for the <hi>natural,</hi> and the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law</hi> of God, although both of them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are moſt perfect in their own kind, and being
joyned do contain the particular Principles of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
faith, and the general Principles of
things to be done, accommodated to all parts of
life, yet neither of them doth deſcend to all thoſe
particulars, which either may be, or for the moſt
part are neceſſary for the preſervation of Peace and
Order, in Cities, and Governments. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ſake, the <hi>Law of reaſon,</hi> which is the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:154344:103"/>
ſame with the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> doth dictate, and the
Scripture alſo in the next verſe of this Chapter
doth teach, that Tribute is to be paid for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainence
of Princes, and of the charges of Wars,
and other publick uſes, but unleſſe it be by a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

or elſe it will not be enough for the uſe;
of the Common-wealth; If you ſay, that by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Argument the neceſſity of Laws is proved indeed,
but the obligation of them is not determined, for
Subjects may be enforced to their duties by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

God, the moſt prudent Moderator of all

whatſoever it is that the Mind rightly conceiveth
doth induce the ſtain of a fault, and a guilt of
puniſhment for that fault, it doth directly appertain
to the obligation of the Conſcience; Now Natural
Reaſon (whoſe Judgement cannot be indirect)
doth ſo far command us to obey <hi>Humane Laws,</hi>
that if that obedience be not performed, we are
immediately conſcious to our ſelves, that it is
meerly by our own fault that we fayl in that Duty.</p>
            <p>XXIX. The fifth Argument; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Violation of
that which neceſſarily draweth along with it the
Violation of the Laws of God, doth oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(becauſe no man with a ſafe Conſcience can
viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te the Law of God which is the Rule of the
Conſcience) but the violation of every particular
Law ſolemnly conſtituted by Men, doth neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
draw along with it the violation of the Law of
God, to wit, of that General Commandment by
which God commandeth obedience to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
Therefore the ſaid Violation of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Law of Men doth oblige the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>XXX. The ſixth Argument; We are bound in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:154344:106"/>
Conſcience not to Act that, which (if it were
acted) is in a manner to reſiſt God himſelf; For
we are bound to be ſubject, and to ſubmit our
ſelves unto God, and therefore not to reſiſt him,
for <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> are contrary unto one
another, neither can any Man at the ſame time, be
ſubject unto, and reſiſt the ſame perſon; But not
to obey Humane Laws ſolemnly conſtituted, is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively,
to reſiſt God; For he who obeyeth
not the Laws, doth diſobey the Legiſlative power
of the Magiſtrate, which whoſoever he is that doth
it (the ſaid power being ordained by God) he doth
oppoſe himſelf againſt Gods Ordinance, and by
Conſequence &amp; interpretatively he doth oppoſe God
himſelf, which is the Determination of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the
ſecond verſe of this chapter, and from whence he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
concludes the neceſſity of Subjection <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>XXXI. From what hath been already ſpoken, it
will be no great difficulty to anſwer to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which commonly are objected by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
to this Truth: The firſt and chiefeſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is taken from <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and to the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of it, many places of Scripture are alleged
with much pomp &amp; circumſtance, which ſeem to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulate
to that <hi>Liberty;</hi> And many are the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> from hence do take their Riſe. They allege,
it is written by St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 7. 23. Yee are bought
with a price, be yee not made the Servants of men;</hi>
And ag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in <hi>Gal. 5. 6. Stand firm in that liberty in
which Chriſt hath ſet you free, and be not intangl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again with the yoak of bondage.</hi> And again <hi>Col.
2. 16. Let no man judge you in meat or drink
&amp;c.</hi> and other places to the ſame effect. They

diſpu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e alſo that it is not likely that Chriſt at laſt
ſhould have freed us ſo from the poſitive Laws of
God himſelf, which were certainly moſt juſt, to
leave us captivated under the ſlaviſh Bondage of the
Laws of Men.</p>
            <p>XXXII. I will anſwer to all theſe places, but
I would have you firſt preadvertiſed, ſeeing that
there are many Texts and heads of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that we diligently do take heed not too raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to confound them, neither rudely and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to wreſt and cite thoſe places of Scripture
which pertain to one kind of Liberty to another
kind to which they do not belong; which <hi>tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to another kind</hi> is not only the perpetual and
Solemn vice of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and the <hi>Anab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
but of many others who would be eſteemed
the Reformers of this age; and this as they often
put in practice in other diſputations, ſo moſt
eſpecially in thoſe where the debate is concerning
the Rites of the Church; having thus pread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
you of their Errors, I now proceed
to the ſolution of their Arguments. In that
Text to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the Apoſtle would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
the faithful, that in whatſoever place God
had conſtituted them, and with whatſoever gifts
he had indued them, that contented in that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they would modeſtly contain themſelves
within their own limits, meaſuring themſelves by
the gifts, and calling of God, and acordingly
accommodate their lives and actions, whether they
be ſervants or free, and not ſo inſlave and emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
their Conſciences to the Judgment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of any Man, as wholly to depend upon his
<hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> but being mindfull that he is the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154344:107"/>
ſervant of God, and of the Lord Jeſus, ſo to ſtudy
to pleaſe men, and to be ſubſervient to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and commands, as to do nothing unworthy
of a man who profeſſeth himſelf to be the Servant
of God and Chriſt; And this being the certain
ſenſe of the Apoſtle in that whole diſcourſe, we
may moſt truly conclude from hence, that we
ought not to be obedient to the pleaſures of Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Parents, or Princes, or any Mortals what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
if they command any thing to be done
which is wicked, or unlawful, for inſtead of being
the Servants of God, this were to make themſelves
the Servants of Men; But he, who out of Conſcience
doth obey the juſt, honeſt, and profitable Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men, is ſo far from being thought, that he is
therefore the Servant of Men, that by the two chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of the Apoſtles, he is expreſſely ſaid <hi>to ſerve the
Lord God, and not Men. Eph. 6. 7. Col.</hi> 3. 23. and
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. In this Text, <hi>To ſerve the Lord and
not Men,</hi> the particle of Negation (as uſually in
other places) is taken comparatively, that is to
ſay, <hi>rather</hi> God than Men, he ſerveth God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and Men for God; He ſerveth Men, as he
performeth what is commanded by them, and he
ſerveth God, as he doth it out of the Conſcience
of his Duty.</p>
            <p>XXXIII. That other place to the <hi>Galathians</hi> is
beſt of all to be underſtood by the whole ſcope of
the Epiſtle; Some falſe Apoſtles in the Churches
of <hi>Galatia,</hi> being either Jews, or Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
did violently contend (contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Apoſtles in the Council at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>)
that the Gentiles newly converted to the
Faith, ſhould not only be baptized but circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:154344:107"/>
alſo; And thoſe Impoſtors, as their cuſtom
is, under the pretence of piety, and a wicked dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
amongſt the credulous vulgar, did ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
prevayl, that they had drawn many into ſo
great an errour, that they thought they could never
attain unto everlaſting happineſſe, unleſſe they
ſuffered themſelves to be circumcized; The Spirit
of the bleſſed Apoſtle not induring this wretched
and growing Impoſture, doth inveigh againſt the
groſſeneſſe of the error of it, with more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Indignation throughout the whole courſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of the Epiſtle; And amongſt other Arguments
he admoniſheth the <hi>Galatians</hi> of that liberty, by
which Chriſt after his comming did free his Church
from the unprofitable burden and yoak of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick</hi>
Ceremonies, and doth exhort them conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to maintain the liberty obtained by the death of
Chriſt, and not to ſtoop their necks again unto the
yoak of ſlavery, which they ſhould altogether do,
if they ſhould believe the ritual obſervation of the
dead letter of the Law to be neceſſary. Now how
incongruouſly this is by the Anabaptiſts applyed
to the Laws of Men, profitable and neceſſary for the
Commonwealth, from which the Scriptures do no
where tell us that Chriſt hath freed us, he is wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blind that doth not diſcern it.</p>
            <p>XXXIV. The third place taken out of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> doth not at all appertain to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws rightly conſtituted concerning things of
a middle nature, but to the Doctrines of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
who dogmatically propounded to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God ſome things to be neceſſary, which God
never commanded (which was the Cuſtom of the
Traditionary Phariſees, whom Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:154344:108"/>
reprehends upon that account for making the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God of no effect by their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
or clean contrary, they as dogmatically did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
other things as unlawful, which God never did
prohibit, injoyning the people as to ſuch, and ſuch
things, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
admoniſheth the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to have a care of
ſuch dogmatizing Teachers, and not ſuffer any
ſnare to be thrown upon their Conſciences by theſe
Impoſtors; Magiſtrates therefore in a political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
do not offend, who in things of a middle
nature, do either command or prohibit any thing
to the people for Profit, Honeſty, Decency, or
for Orders ſake, but without any opinion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
on either ſide, which belongeth to the thing
it ſelf that is commanded or forbidden; Thoſe pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Miniſters (I may more truly call them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
ſo Magiſterially they do pronounce all
things do rather offend, who ſo importunately
vex and inveigh againſt the harmleſſe Laws of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and exerciſe a Tyranny o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the people, and whatſoever is diſtaſtful
to them, is preſently condemned for Impiety, or
at leaſt for Superſtition.</p>
            <p>XXXV. That which in the fourth place they do
allege, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> becauſe Chriſt hath freed us from the
poſitive Laws of God, therefore much more from
the Laws of Men, is in many reſpects erroneous,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and abſurd; For in the firſt place it is not truly ſaid,
that Chriſt hath freed us from the poſitive Laws of
God, by which we never were bound; For the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Laws of God, or Men, do only oblige thoſe
on whom they are impoſed; Now thoſe Laws of
God which they call <hi>poſitive,</hi> and from which they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:154344:108"/>
would have us freed by the death of Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be <hi>ritual</hi> or <hi>judicial</hi> were only impoſed
on the Jews, but not on us who are Chriſtians. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
where it is manifeſt what God would have
done, it doth not belong to us by any collation of
Comparatives too ſaucily to determine what ought
to be done; Now it is manifeſt that God would
have both, he would have that his poſitive Laws
delivered to the Iſraelits by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould not oblige
the Chriſtians, and that the Laws of men rightly
and ſolemnly conſtituted by the Magiſtrates ſhould
oblige the people under their Authority. Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
If this Argument indeed were of any force, thoſe
that make uſe of it do not obſerve, that by it they
do not only take away the <hi>obligation,</hi> but altogether
the <hi>uſe</hi> alſo of all humane Lawes; For Chriſt hath no
otherwiſe freed us from the obligation of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck</hi>
Laws, than ſo by taking away the uſe of them,
that by us they are no more to be eſteemed as Laws.
Therefore if in the ſame manner he would have us
to be free from the obligation of humane Laws, it
muſt of neceſſity follow, that he would have no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws to be any longer extant amongſt us. So
wild a propoſition is this of the Anabaptiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fanatick perſons, neither is it admitted by
themſelves who do propound it.</p>
            <p>XXXVI. Again, they object that of Saint <hi>James,</hi>
Chapter the fourth, <hi>there is but one Law-giver,</hi> to
wit <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is only Lord of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
He is an invader thereof of Chriſts right,
and thruſts himſelf into the Throne of God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he is that aſſumeth unto himſelf a power of
obliging the Conſciences of other men. I anſwer,
There is indeed but one ſupreme Law-giver, who
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:154344:109"/>
hath a direct and Soveraign command over the
Conſciences of men, as <hi>by himſelf</hi> and by his own
virtue and authority to oblige them, which Law-giver
is God and Chriſt, as the Apoſtle hath it; But
this hinders not, but that there may be other Law-givers
of an inferiour order and degree, who by a
power granted and derived to them from that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Lawgiver, have of themſelves a right of
making Laws which may conſequently oblige the
Conſcience; Juſt as a King who ſolely in his own
Kingdom hath a peculiar Legiſlative power, yet
notwithſtanding by his Charter he may give to ſome
College or Corporation, a right of making Laws,
which may oblige all the members of that body,
not by their own power, but by the force of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Donation, and the Authority granted to them
from the King; Our Univerſities (as you all know)
are happy and rejoice in this privilege, that in a
Legitimate Convocation they may make Laws
which we call Statutes, and ordain puniſhments
for Delinquents, and if it be expedient, they may
abrogate again and cancel the ſame Statutes; Now
there is no man of a ſober underſtanding who will
conceive that the excerciſe of this power doth any
wayes derogate from the Legiſlative right of the
King, or can be any deceit, or prejudice unto it,
unleſs it be extended beyond the limits of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
defined in the Charter; Nay it is rather an
excellent, and a ſingular mark of the royal <hi>autocraſy,</hi>
that the King hath not only the Legiſlative power
himſelf, but that he can vouchſafe it unto others to
be had and uſed, his own right being notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſafe and entire into himſelf.</p>
            <p>XXXVII. The other objections relying on one
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:154344:109"/>
&amp; the ſame Foundation may be reſolved by one a
and the ſame labour; I will briefly run them over.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
In the third place they object, that the Civil power
is meerly <hi>temporal,</hi> &amp; therefore belongeth not unto
the Conſcience which is <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> Fourthly, the end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of Humane Laws is the <hi>external</hi> peace of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and not the <hi>internal</hi> peace of the
Conſcience; therefore the Laws themſelves do only
oblige the outward man, and not the Conſcience
which lyeth within. Fifthly, the Magiſtrate cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
judge of Conſciences, and therefore can make no
Laws over them, it being the ſame extent of power,
to give Laws, and to judge according to them.
Sixtly, the Magiſtrate in making of Laws hath no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
intention of binding the Conſciences of the people,
but only to oblige them to perform that which the
Law commandeth, which if it be done, it is all one
to the profit of the Commonwealth, whether it be
done out of any Conſcience of duty or not, and it is
enough if the effects of <hi>Actions</hi> be commenſurated
to the intention of the <hi>Agents,</hi> and they ought not
further to be extended.</p>
            <p>XXXVIII. I anſwer, and firſt <hi>univerſally</hi> to
them all; By all theſe Arguments, this only is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that humane Laws do not oblige <hi>directly</hi> and
<hi>by themſelves,</hi> or by their proper force, which of our
own accord we grant; for we aſſert no other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
but what comes to them <hi>ex conſequenti,</hi> by
Conſequence, and by the virtue of the general
command of God of rendring obedience to the
higher powers; And from this ground, I anſwer
to the particular objections; And as the to third, I
ſay, that the Civil power being meerly temporal,
cannot of it ſelf, and in reſpect of the Object in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:154344:110"/>
which properly and immediately it verſeth, have a
ſpiritual effect, and therefore of it ſelf cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a ſpiritual obligation; nevertheleſſe by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it may have a ſpiritual effect, by a derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the power of ſome ſuperiour cauſe, in the
virtue whereof it worketh; Now every Magiſtrate,
as long as rightly and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely he doth exerciſe the
Legiſlative Power which God hath put into his
hands; he worketh in the virtue of God himſelf,
and by ordination of him who is himſelf a <hi>Spirit,</hi>
and as the Lord and Father of <hi>Spirits</hi> hath a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over the <hi>Spirits of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXXIX. I anſwer to the fourth; that although
<hi>peace</hi> be an external bleſſing of a Commonalty, yet
the internal Conſcience is obliged to the uttermoſt
to the procuring and preſerving of it by all lawful
and honeſt means, becauſe that God the Lord of
Conſcience hath commanded us to love and follow
<hi>peace,</hi> and if private, certainly much more publick
peace. Neither is it any way inconſiſtent, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Conſcience be internal, yet it is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to a thing external; for the obligation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
doth not ariſe from the Nature, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>Object</hi> into which it is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but from the <hi>will</hi> of him who hath the right of
obliging, that is God himſelf.</p>
            <p>XL. I anſwer to the fifth; that the Legiſlative
and Judicial power doth <hi>originally</hi> pertain to the
ſame perſon, that is, to him who hath the ſupreme
juriſdiction over the Subjects; nevertheleſs <hi>diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatively</hi>
and by the will of the ſupreme Magiſtrate
it may both of them and both ways be adminiſtred
by other perſons, as he ſhall think expedient. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
although God alone hath in himſelf a peculiar
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:154344:110"/>
power over the Conſciences of the Creature, and
maketh as well as judgeth Laws by an original, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and abſolute right, yet according to his good
pleaſure he may either delegate a diſpenſation of
either power to another, or he may reſerve it to
himſelf; Therefore it would not be abſurd if any
man ſhould grant that God in ſome meaſure hath
delegated a Legiſlative power to the Magiſtrate of
obliging Conſciences, but hath reſerved the Judicial
power over them entire unto himſelf; But there
is no neceſſity that compelleth us to grant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
to uſe any expreſſions that may be helped although
by never ſo gentle an interpretation; For we do
not ſay this, that God hath given to the Magiſtrate
a power to oblige by his Laws the Conſciences of
thoſe that be under him, but this rather (which is
a more wary and a more commodiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> kind of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
that God hath given to the Magiſtrate a power
of making Laws, which (but by the only Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God himſelf) do oblige the Conſciences
of his Subjects; For to ſpeak properly, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
doth not oblige the Conſcience to obey the
Law, but God obligeth the Conſcience to obey the
Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>XL. And by this, a way is made for an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to

                  </gap> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi>
As in the generation of a Monſter (which
being but boyes we have learned from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>)
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:154344:111"/>
the effect, which is the production of the Monſter,
is beſides the intention of the <hi>ſecond cauſe,</hi> or as
they ſpeak it, of <hi>Nature natured,</hi> that is to ſay, of the
perſon that begets or brings it forth, but it is not
beſides the intention of the firſt Cauſe, or of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the Magiſtrate in the making of a Law hath
no explicit intention of obliging the Conſciences,
yet by inſtituting the Law, he doth inſtitute that,
which by the intention, &amp; ordination of God, hath
an implicit force of obliging them, &amp; which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
is conjoyned to him. And this may ſuffice to
be ſpoken of the obligation of Humane Laws in
general; I will ſhortly proceed to the Queſtions,

what I have propounded to be
ſpoken concerning the obligation

<hi>whether humane Laws do oblige
the Conſciences of Subjects?</hi> Concerning which in
the former Lecture I have expounded to you what
was my Judgment of it; The other Queſtion is, <hi>How
they oblige?</hi> To which queſtion, I have told you, there

               </gap> of one kind, therefore to avoid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and that we may proceed in ſome Order
and Method to that which is to be ſpoken, I have
thought is not impertinent to give you a rough Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
of the whole Treatiſe now in hand;
And that Method which moſt of you do remember, I
obſerved in thoſe my former exercitations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>obligation of an oath,</hi> I here conceive it very
neceſſary for me to uſe again, that thoſe things may
all of them be reduced to the <hi>four kind of Cauſes</hi>
which I conceive may commodiouſly be referred to
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But becauſe I do find many things to remain
which cannot eaſily be included in thoſe bounds, we
will aſſigne them their ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>laſſes; And they are
chiefly two, the firſt of <hi>Perſons</hi> who are under the
obligation of thoſe Laws; and the other in the
<hi>comparing</hi> of the <hi>obligatory Vertue</hi> which is in
Humane Laws, with that which ariſeth from the
Judgement of the Conſcience, by Vowes, Oaths,
Promiſes, Contracts, and from the Law of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
or if there be any thing elſe which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where

of Colleges, and leſſe ſocieties, will not peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be very neceſſary ſeeing in ſome manner they
may be reduced to ſomthing in <hi>the four kinds of
Cauſes,</hi> and though not ſo aptly as to ſatisfy the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:154344:112"/>
curious, yet ſo fully as to ſerve our preſent purpoſe;
for whilſt our hearers underſtand what it is we ſpeak
of, we have never taken any great care in what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
we have gone. We will in the firſt place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(if God ſhall grant life, health, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to accompliſh what we have propounded)
ſpeak of the obligation of the Laws as to the four
kinds of Cauſes; In the ſecond place of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who are obliged to the obſervation of thoſe
Laws; And laſtly, of the <hi>compariſon</hi> of the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations</hi>
which quarrel amongſt themſelves, giving
you before-hand one or two diſtinctions which will
be of great concernment in the whole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>II. We muſt underſtand therefore in the firſt
place, Seeing that to the end of Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and order, there is a two-fold power in thoſe
who are inveſted with Soveraign Authority, A
<hi>directive power,</hi> by which the Subjects may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what they have to do, and a <hi>Power Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active</hi>
or <hi>Coercitive</hi> (for, by reaſon of the Analogy,
it is better ſo to call it than Coercive) by which
the Subjects may be compelled to the performance
of thoſe things that are commanded, if of their own
accords they ſhall refuſe to give obedience to them,
both which are ſo contained in the Laws, that the
one conſiſteth moſt in precepts, and the other is
moſt to be ſeen in puniſhments; there ariſeth
from this double power of the Magiſtrate, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
duty of the Subject which anſwereth to that
double power; The duty of Obedience in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Directive power, and the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
in reference to the power Coercitive; I
here underſtand <hi>ſubjection</hi> as it is properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:154344:113"/>
by an appellation Generical, which as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
it often comes to paſſe, is reſtrained to one
certain <hi>Species;</hi> For obedience alſo is a <hi>Species</hi> of
Subjection largely taken; The Apoſtle compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
both thoſe duties, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
them in thoſe two words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Obey them that have the overſight of you, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your ſelves;</hi> The firſt whereof pertaineth to
the Duty of <hi>obedience,</hi> or of performing that
which is commanded by a lawful Superior, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Duty of <hi>Subjection,</hi> or of induring
what by him ſhall be inflicted. Furthermore, As
from a double Power, there ariſeth a double Duty,
ſo from a double Duty, there ariſeth a double Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
for every Duty doth infer an Obligation,
and every Obligation doth ſuppoſe a Duty; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one kind of the Obligation of Humane Laws, is
that, by which Subjects are bound to obey the
precepts of the Law it ſelf, and the other, by
which they are bound to ſubmit themſelves to the
power of the Law-giver, one of the Obligations
belongeth to <hi>Active Obedience,</hi> the other unto that
Obedience which is called <hi>paſſive,</hi> and to which
we give the Name of <hi>Submiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. If it be here demanded how farr Humane
Laws can oblige the Conſciences of the Subject;
It is to be ſaid in the firſt place, that all Laws made
by one inveſted by a lawful Power, do oblige to
Subjection, ſo that it is not lawful for a Subject to
reſiſt the Supreme Power by force of Arms, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things juſt or unjuſt be commanded. This

               </gap>us Tyranny of the greateſt Enemies
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154344:113"/>
to the name of Chriſt; &amp; to make no mention herein
of the Conduct, and the inſtinct of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the
light of <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> this is moſt manifeſt by the
Doctrine of the two chiefeſt of the Apoſtles. For ſo
<hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle of Circumciſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth diligently
inſtruct the Jews; And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> the Doctor of the
Gentiles, doth as carefully inſtruct the Gentiles;
St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the firſt book and ſecond chapter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
Servants to be ſubject to their Maſters, not
only good and gentle Maſters, but thoſe ſeverer
ones, who would puniſh them with Scourges,
when they had not deſerved it. Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi>
13. doth urge in many words the neceſſity of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
but granteth unto none the Liberty of
Reſiſtance, be their caſe, or their pretence, never ſo
good. In the ſecond place, I ſay, That although
this Subjection is <hi>ſimply neceſſary,</hi> yet it is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
as to <hi>Duty,</hi> unleſſe the command of the
Law be obeyed where it can be done without Sin,
And therefore the Subject is bound to Obedience
in Conſcience, in all things that are lawful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
Hence it is, that this word <hi>be Obedient</hi> is ſo
often, and ſo expreſſely inculcated by the Apoſtle.
<hi>Eph. 6. Col.</hi> 3. and in other places. In the third
place, I ſay, Where the precept of the Law cannot
be obſerved without ſin, if the Subject ſhall pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſubmit himſelf to the Power of the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
he hath ſatisfied his Duty, and is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in Conſcience to perform that which the Law
commandeth; nay, he is obliged not to do it; for
there can be no Obligation to things unlawful; It
is alwayes neceſſary therefore to be ſubject, but
not alwayes neceſſary to obey.</p>
            <p>IV. Furthermore, ſeeing both are certain, that

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

the Conſciences of Men are free,<note place="margin">Servitus in totum hominem uon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendit. <hi>Sen. de Bencf.</hi> 20.</note> and ought to be
ſo, which Liberty no Humane Power can, or may
infringe; And that an <hi>Obligation</hi> is a kind of a
Bond, and doth induce a neceſſity, which ſeemeth
to be oppoſite, and to fight with <hi>juſt Liberty</hi> (for
neither is he any wayes free who is bound, neither
can he be free to both, who by ſome neceſſity is
bound to either) that it plainly may appear that
this Obligation of Conſcience, of which we now
do treat, may conſiſt with the juſt Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
we muſt neceſſarily in this place give you
another diſtinction, which is, that the <hi>Precepts</hi> of
Humane Law may be taken two wayes, either <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi>
for the <hi>Act</hi> it ſelf of giving the precepts, or
<hi>materially</hi> for the <hi>thing precepted;</hi> If the Law-giver
therefore ſhould intend an Obligation, or impoſe
on the Subject a neceſſity of obeying, from giving
the Precept of his Law taken <hi>materially,</hi> that is,
from the neceſſity of the thing it ſelf which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
which notwithſtanding in the truth of the
thing, was not neceſſary before that Law was made,
he in that very fact ſhould lay a force upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of the Subject, which ſhould be repugnant
to the Liberty of it; But if he ſhould derive his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
from giving the precept of his Law taken <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi>
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> is from the legitimate Authority with w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi>
he himſelf is inveſted that gives it (a moral indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
of the thing precepted in the mean time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
and in the ſame ſtate in which it was before
the Law was made) although the obligation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
which impoſeth on the Conſcience a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of obeying, yet the inward Liberty of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
remaineth uninjuried and intire.</p>
            <p>V. If this ſeems obſcure to any, I will illuſtrate
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:154344:115"/>
it unto him by an Example; A Civil Law being
made, that no man ſhould eat fleſh during all
the time of Lent, if the Law-giver either in the
preface or in the body of that Law ſhould ſignify
that he laid this Command upon his Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it were ungodly, and unlawful for them in
that time to eat fleſh, This were to throw a Snare
on the Conſciences of his Subjects, &amp; as much as in
him lay to weaken their Liberty; But if expreſſely he
ſhould ſignify, that the thing being otherwiſe free
in it ſelf, he did ſo ordain it for the profit of the
Commonwealth, that his Subjects according to the
Example of the antient Church, ſhould thereby
take an occaſion to exerciſe a more abſtemious and
ſeverer Diſcipline; or if by the words of the Law
it ſelf, or elſewhere it might appear, that the
Law-giver intended not by that Law to faſten any
opinion of neceſſity on the thing ſo commanded,
there would on this account no injury be done to
the Conſciences of the Subjects, and the liberty
thereof. For there is a great difference, when one
thing is commanded by the Magiſtrate, becauſe it is
thought to be neceſſary, oris prohibited, becauſe it is
conceived to be unlawful, And when another thing
begins then only to be thought neceſſary and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
after that it is commanded by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
and unlawful, becauſe it is forbidden by
him. The firſt Neceſſity which anteceded the Law,
and is ſuppoſed by it to be ſome cauſe of it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the liberty of the Conſcience; but the
other, which followeth the Law, and proceedeth
from it as an eſſect thereof is not repugnant to it;
The reaſon of this difference is, becauſe the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
neceſſity which the Law ſuppoſeth, doth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:154344:116"/>
neceſſarily require ſome aſſent of the <hi>practical
judgement;</hi> but to the following neceſſity which
proceedeth from the Law, the conſent of the will
is ſufficient to the performance of that outward
work which by the Law is commanded. Now an
<hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> cannot prejudice the liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
as an <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>judgment</hi> doth, for the
<hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> doth follow the dictates of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
as the <hi>effect</hi> followeth its <hi>cauſe,</hi> but the
<hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Judgment</hi> doth precede thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,
as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> goeth before its <hi>effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. Theſe diſtinctions being premiſed, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
unto the <hi>Doubts,</hi> where in the firſt place thoſe
which we meet with concerning <hi>the material Cauſe</hi>
ſhall be examined and diſcuſſed at this time. The
firſt doubt is <hi>De materia impoſſibili, of a matter in
it ſelf impoſſible,</hi> concerning which I ſay in the firſt
place, That no Law ought to be made concerning a
matter altogether impoſſible; If ſuch a Law be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> made, it is tyrannical, and by right null, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
no man in Conſcience; The firſt reaſon is,
becauſe that Laws are made in relation to <hi>Acts,</hi> as,
to be acted by a man who is a free Agent; now
liberty ſpeaketh a power unto both, but in things
impoſſible there is no ſuch liberty of power, as by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it ſelf is manifeſt. Secondly, No man by right can be
obliged to the performance of that, the omiſſion
whereof cannot be imputed as a <hi>fault</hi> unto him, nor
ought to be imputed to him for <hi>puniſhment</hi> (for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
obligation is either to a <hi>fault,</hi> or to a <hi>puniſhment,</hi>
or to both) but the omiſſion of a thing impoſſible
cannot be imputed to any man for a fault, nor ought
it to be imputed to any one for a puniſhment: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
&amp;c.</hi> But that there is no obligation of a thing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:154344:116"/>
impoſſible (whether it be impoſſible by the Nature
of the thing, or by circumſtances,<note place="margin">Praelect. 2. Sect. 12.</note> or any other
way) hath already by me been proved in my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>the obligation of an oath,</hi> and there is no need
of repetition.</p>
            <p>VII. I ſay in the ſecond place; A Law which is
poſſible to ſome, but ſeemeth to any other, or to
but few, or peradventure but to one or two to be
impoſſible, may lawfully be made, if it be uſeful to
the Common-wealth, but not unleſs there be ſome
extraordinary great cauſe, and a manifeſt neceſſity
doth require it; but being made it doth oblige all
thoſe who are able to keep it, but not thoſe who
cannot keep it; as if ſome great Tribute were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
for the neceſſary uſe of the Common-wealth,
for the payment whereof ſome of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are nothing ſo able as others, Thoſe who are
ſo poor that they cannot pay the ſum which the
Law lays upon them, are not bound in Conſcience
to do that which they are unable to perform, as is
already apparent by the propoſition above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
Nevertheleſſe they are obliged to make their
addreſſes to thoſe who are over them,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </note> and openly,
and ſincerely, and without the leaſt falſhood, to
profeſſe the ſlenderneſſe of their Eſtate, and unleſs
they can prevail to be quite exempted from the
Law, or to procure a remiſſion of ſome part of the
ſum with which they are taxed, they are to bring
into the publick as great a part of it, as poſſibly they
can; for he who cannot do what he ought to do, he
yet ought to do what he is able to do.</p>
            <p>VIII. The ſecond <hi>doubt is,</hi> concerning a thing
commanded by the Law, not impoſſible, but very
grievous, and very burthenſome, and which the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:154344:117"/>
Subject cannot perform without great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
loſſe, danger of life, and the ruine of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
whole Eſtate; I ſay in the firſt place, That in this
caſe the Law-giver (if he foreſeeth this will come
to paſſe) ought to uſe ſome caution in the clauſes of
that Law, and as conveniently as he can, he is to
provide a remedy for this Evil; And if it cannot ſo
well be done in the form of the Law it ſelf (le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
ſubtile and deceitful Knaves, and too much intent
to their own profit may thereby find a hole to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note>
and ſo elude the force of the Law) yet
what poſſibly in him lyeth, he ought to provide,
that in the execution of that Law ſome qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be had, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t a Law otherwiſe profitable and

               </gap>re or a detriment to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
honeſt man. I ſay in the ſecond place, That the
Subject, though ſo heavily taxed, is nevertheleſſe
bound in Conſcience to obey that Law, although
with the ruine of his whole Eſtate, if any evident
or neceſſary Cauſe for the good of the Common-wealth
doth ſo require. For example, ſuppoſe a
hoſtile Army be invading the Kingdom, if a Law
be made that all the corn in the Fields, for ſome
miles, not far from the Shore, be ſpoiled, and all
the Corn in the Barnes or Ricks which cannot be
carried away, be burned, and that all the Houſes
in the Suburbs be pulled down, and that all the Slu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereabouts ſhall be opened, and the Fields be
drowned, every Citizen and Subject is directly
bound to obey this Law, and cheerfully, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to obey the Commands thereof, and with the
loſs of his own goods to redeem the publick ſafety,
&amp; not only upon that account, that his Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betrayed to his Enemies by his unſeaſonable

parſimoniouſneſs, it is ſure enough that every
private perſon will be ſuddenly ſenſible of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
calamity, but eſpecially out of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his duty; becauſe that every good man is

I ſay in the third place, That a Subject, unleſſe ſome
remarkable neceſſity doth appear or fear of publick <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
danger, is ordinarily not obliged to obey a Law
that is ſo extremely burthenſome as to bring with
it the certain ruine of his whole Eſtate, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger of his life; But he is bound, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
hath been already ſpoken, (and which almoſt
in all caſes I would have you to obſerve, that we
may need not any more to repeat it to you,)
to make not the leaſt reſiſtance, but patiently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
whatſoever injury or contumely ſhall be
brought upon him by the ſuperiour powers.</p>
            <p>IX. The third doubt, is concerning things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
as if the Law of men ſhould command any
thing which was neceſſary before, and commanded
by the Law of God, or forbid any thing which
was before unlawful and prohibited by the Law of
God; What is the obligation in this caſe? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
briefly, That the Subject by this Law is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
obliged; For firſt, the obligation which was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in force before the Law of God doth not hinder
the effect of the Law of man by excluding a new
obligation, for a man by many bonds may be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the performance of one and the ſame duty,
as I have already declared in the former Lecture;
to which reaſon we may alſo adde another, which
is that oftentimes the Law of man doth adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Law of God, to wit, by determining
the Act, as to the ſubſtance of it commanded by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154344:118"/>
the Law of God, and therefore neceſſary, as to
the <hi>manner, quantity</hi> or ſome other <hi>circumſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
of it which was free before, or by adding ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
to the Law of God prohibiting a thing
unlawfull, as to the <hi>degree</hi> of the <hi>Crime,</hi> or the
<hi>manner of the puniſhment,</hi> or the <hi>meaſure</hi> of it,
or other things of the like nature; for examples
ſake, it is by Divine right that there ſhould be
publick congregations to perform the duties of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip, but at what hour the people ſhall
meet, and in what place, what form of words are to
be uſed, and what muſt be the geſture of the body
the ſeveral parts of the ſervice, and other things
of the ſame nature, are all of them to be determined
by Humane conſtitutions. In the ſame manner,
the Law of God forbiddeth Theft to be commited,
but what kind of Theft is to be animadvertiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
with ſuch a puniſhment, and what with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
puniſhment, is from the Laws of man; From
this determination of a <hi>general thing</hi> and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the Law of God, the Law of man hath
this privilege, that it can induce a new obligation
on the Conſcience of the Subject, not only
different from the firſt obligation in <hi>number,</hi> and
in reſpect of the <hi>Term,</hi> becauſe it is of another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,
but alſo diverſe in the Species, and in
reſpect of the matter, becauſe it is exerciſed on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>object;</hi> for the firſt obligation, which ariſeth
from the Law of God is to the thing it ſelf as it is
a <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but this obligation which the Lawes
of men do ſuper-induce, is to the <hi>manner</hi> of the
thing or to the <hi>circumſtance</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>X. The fourth <hi>Doubt,</hi> is of a thing that is foul
and unlawful, which is indeed a Doubt of great
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:154344:118"/>
moment, and containeth many caſes: for almoſt all
the Conditions which are required to the right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Lawes,<note n="a" place="margin">

                  </gap>. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtot. 5. Ethic. 3</note> are reduced to Juſtice alone;
And not only for that reaſon that <hi>univerſal Juſtice</hi>
doth in her Circle comprehend all Vertues, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
for this reaſon, that <hi>particular Juſtice,</hi> and
more ſpecifically that Juſtice which is called <hi>Legal
Juſtice,</hi> is above all other Vertues the <hi>chief and the
only Pillar</hi> of Common-wealths and all humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.
Concerning this <hi>Doubt,</hi> In the firſt place
it is queſtioned, Whether an unjuſt Law ought to be
made for the publick profit; Of which opinion was
<hi>Nicho. Machiavel,</hi> who affirmed, that the due
matter of Laws, whether juſt, or unjuſt, was that
which was moſt commodious for the preſerving &amp;
the encreaſing of a politick State; for when, in his
opinion, the end of Civil Power is the preſervation
of it ſelf, and the encreaſe of Soveraignty, which
Power cannot vigorouſly be preſerved, much leſs
the Soveraignty enlarged, if all the Lawes, and
Councils of Princes were examined according to
the exact Rule of Juſtice, and Honeſty, It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
thoſe who ſate at the Helm, ſo to bend
(as occaſion ſhould require) the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Honeſty,</hi>
as to make it ſubſervient to the publick advantage;
for the <hi>end</hi> in all things is to know how beſt to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thoſe things that are of a <hi>middle nature;</hi> what
ſo ever was the opinion of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> this was
certainly the Judgment of a perſonage of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
amongſt the Lacaedemonians, who openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
that was moſt honeſt to the Spartans
which was moſt profitable to them; To confirm

Principle this is, may be proved by the Example

moſt happily have far and near extended the
bounds of their Empire throughout <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi>
and <hi>Europe.</hi> And to ſpeak the truth, had not ſome

not every where groaned under ſo many Sacrileges,
Perjuries, Seditions, Warrs, Tumults, and
Tyrannies.</p>
            <p>XI. But on the other ſide; Princes on earth
ought not to abuſe that power which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from God, againſt his will, or otherwiſe
than he intended, for this power is not given them
ſo much as to Lords, as it is intruſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to them by
God as his Miniſters, <gap reason="foreign">

is that the meaning of <hi>Horace,</hi> as if Honeſty were
meerly to be meaſured by profit, the ſcope of his
ſenſe is far otherwiſe, to wit, that men wild at
firſt, and wandring, by the obſervation of the publick
profit, and the common good, were brought at the
laſt to draw together into one Body, and maintain
Societies, and by juſt Laws and Puniſhments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
injuries, and wickedneſſe. The Arguments
drawn from the Turks (whom it appears that God
eſpecially had raiſed up, and made them as his
Scourge to correct the great perfidiouſneſſe, and
other Sins of the Chriſtians) or from any others,
to maintain a bad Cauſe by the proſperous ſucceſſe
that did attend it, do favour rather of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
of ſome abhominable miſcreant, than of the Purity
of the Goſpel of our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
            <p>XII. The ſecond Queſtion is, Whether an unjuſt
Law (though it ought not to be made, yet being
made) may oblige the Conſcience of the Subject
ſo far, as to be bound to obſerve it? For many
things there are which ought not to be done, yet
being done are valid; And it may ſo come to paſſe,
that what could not without ſin be commanded,
yet without ſin may be performed, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
we have confirmed in our fore-going
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:154344:120"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:154344:121"/>
Lectures. The reaſon of this doubt is, Becauſe
that true obedience is no Diſputreſſe; for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of obedience doth properly conſiſt in this, to
ſubject ones ſelf to the will of another without the
leaſt murmur or diſpute; <hi>Nimis delicata eſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,</hi>
ſaith Bernard, <hi>quae tranſit in genus cauſae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberativum;
That Obedience is too delicate when it
comes once to be ſo deliberate, as to inquire after the
Cauſe thereof.</hi> But I anſwer briefly, the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Subject is not bound by that Law; It
was my firſt Concluſion in the former Lecture, and
confirmed by many Arguments, and if any man be
yet unſatisfied, it may be further proved; For no
inferior power can oblige againſt the will of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
power; therefore the power of God being
above all the power of Men, there is no power of
any man whatſoever that can oblige againſt the will
of God, who by his Law hath forbidden all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and filthy things; from whence is that of Saint
<hi>Auguſtin, There can be ſeen no Law which is not juſt;</hi>
And by this reaſon, the Argument drawn from that
of obedience is anſwered, by granring that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ought to ſubmit himſelf without diſpute to the
will of his Superior, <hi>to wit,</hi> the ſupreme ſuperior,
into whoſe will, all obedience is ultimately reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;<note place="margin">Quod ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet homo, prohibet Deus: &amp; ego audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Deo? <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and not of the ſubordinate Superior, if it
appeareth that his will is averſe to the ſupreme ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior;
Now, God is abſolutely the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
the bare ſignification of whoſe will is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to induce an obligation of Obedience, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince it is moſt certain, that his will cannot be
unjuſt; Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
thoſe things, which if God himſelf had
not given him the charge, might ſeem not only to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:154344:121"/>
be hard, and unjuſt, but impious and full of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
To wit, that his Father, his Country and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
being all abandoned, he ſhould become a poor
baniſhed Man, and travel into a remote, and an
unknown Country, nay, that with his own hand he
ſhould cut the throat of his own Son, in whom alone
was not only all the Comfort, and the Succour of
his Age, but all the Hope of the Promiſes of God,
and that he ſhould lay him on the Altar, and offer
him as a Sacrifice to that God who commanded of
him ſuch cruel things. He did rightly indeed, and as
it became a man who deſerved to be called the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Faithful,</hi> and to be the ſingular Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of an unſhaken Faith to all the world; without
the leaſt haeſitation and with a moſt willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he made himſelf ready to put in Execution the
Commands of God; But as for the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men, ſeeing that every man is lyable to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and ſin, and <hi>his Will</hi> may be depraved, it
is very lawful, nay where there is a juſt Cauſe
of ſuſpition, it is needful alſo, to examine and to
try them. That admonition of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Theſs.
5. 2. Try all things, and keep that which is good,</hi> may
with great right and as fitly be applyed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Superiors, as to the Inſtructions of
Teachers, of whom notwithſtanding St. <hi>Paul</hi> in
that place doth eſpecially ſpeak. Away then
with the haughtineſs and proud commands of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lording
Spirits; <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo; This will I have,
This I do command;</hi> Away with the baſe flattery
of the Papiſts, who think it a ſin for any man in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
manner whatſoever, to ſuſpect the Dictates of
their Lateran <hi>Jove:</hi> Away with their blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
by which thoſe that enter into their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:154344:122"/>
Houſes do by a vow oblige themſelves to obey
their Superiors in every thing, and in all things
without diſtinction.</p>
            <p>XIII. In the third place it is propounded; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Lawful for a Subject to depart from his
own right,<note place="margin">Pura ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, ut nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtè juberi, ſic nec li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt fieri. <hi>Bernard. Epiſt.</hi> 7.</note> and although he be not obliged, yet of
his own accord to obey ſuch an evil Law? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
it is not lawful; for the law of God doth
ſimply oblige to the not doing of any thing that is
evil, or unlawful; Therefore an unjuſt Law (I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<hi>unjuſt</hi> in that ſenſe in which we now
ſpeak, as unjuſt in relation to the matter) cannot
lawfully be kept, becauſe God cannot lawfully be
offended; For whatſoever is repugnant to the Law
of God, or to the light of Nature known and
written in our hearts, or revealed in the written
word, is not to be admitted by a Chriſtian, either
to avoyd any particular detriment whatſoever, or
the ſcandal of our Neighbours, or to promote the
favour, or to decline the hatred of our Superiors;
<hi>Daveniam Imperator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tu Carcerem, ille Gehennam,</hi>
were the words of the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe

            </p>
            <p>XIV. In the fourth place, it is demanded, What
Law is to be thought ſo unjuſt, that it is not only
not obliging, but moreover it is unlawful to obey
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:154344:122"/>
it? I anſwer, a Law may be ſaid to be unjuſt for
manifold conſiderations; Firſt if it be made by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
one who is not inveſted with a lawful power, and
ſo it is unjuſt <hi>Proper defectum Juſtitiae Commutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae,
for the defect of Juſtice commutative,</hi> becauſe
the Lawgiver aſſumeth more than is due or by right
doth belong unto him, it doth not therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Subject to obedience, nevertheleſſe the
Subject if it ſeems expedient to him, and he be
not otherwiſe hindred, may depart from his own
right, and obey that Law. Secondly in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of the <hi>Final cauſe,</hi> if it doth not tend to the
publick good, nor preſerve the rights due unto the
Commonalty; And this Law is unjuſt by reaſon
of the defect of that Juſtice which they call <hi>Legal,</hi>
which alwayes intendeth the common good, and
that the republick may receive no detriment;<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> But
this Law, howſoever it be unjuſt, doth notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oblige the Subject, for the Subject is no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
nor fit Judge of <hi>Legal Juſtice,</hi> and if by his
obedience any thing doth follow which is either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious,
or noxious to the Commonwealth,
it is not to be imputed to him, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his part well enough, but to the Supreme
Magiſtrate, whoſe duty it was to provide for the
preſervation and advancement of the publick good.
Thirdly in conſideration of the <hi>Formal Cauſe,</hi> if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the Law by an unequal proportion, and not by
merit of the Citizens, doth diſpence and diſtr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
Burdens and Favors, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niſhments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
This Law is unjuſt by reaſon of the defect
of <hi>Juſtice diſtributive,</hi> which commandeth to
give all things by equity to every one, as every one
hath deſerved; And this Law, howſoever it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154344:123"/>
doth notwithſtanding oblige, as well as that, of
which but now I ſpoke of, and for the ſame
Cauſe; for the diſpenſation of theſe things doth
not belong to the office of a Subject, but of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magiſtrate. Fourthly, in conſideration of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the <hi>material Cauſe,</hi> of which we do now diſcourſe;
if the Law doth command any thing that is baſe,
diſhoneſt, or any wayes unlawful, the ſaid Law is
unjuſt, for the defect of that Juſtice which is called
<hi>Univerſal,</hi> which requireth a due rectitude in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Action; And this alone is ſo far from obliging
the Subject to obedience, that it doth altogether
oblige him to render no obedience to it.</p>
            <p>XV. It is demanded in the fifth place, What
Juſtice is required, and how much of it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
as to this, that a Law may be ſaid to be juſt,
and eſteemed obligatory? For anſwer, I ſay in the
firſt place, It is not neceſſarily required, that what
by the Law is commanded, ſhould be <hi>juſt poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
which the Philoſophers call <hi>Honeſt,</hi> that is,
that it may be an Act of ſome Virtue, but it doth
ſuffice, if it be <hi>juſt negatively,</hi> that is, if it be not
unjuſt, or ſhameful, as are the Acts of all Vices;
Otherwiſe there could no Laws be made of things
of a middle nature, or of things indifferent, which
notwithſtanding (as by and by ſhall be manifeſt)
are the moſt apt matter of Laws. I ſay in the
ſecond place, Grant that ſome Law be unjuſt, in
regard of the <hi>Cauſe efficient,</hi> or the <hi>final,</hi> or the
<hi>formal Cauſe,</hi> in any of thoſe reſpects newly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet if there be no defect of Juſtice in reſpect
of the <hi>material Cauſe,</hi> that is, If by the force &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Law the Act to be performed by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be ſuch that he may put it in Execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:154344:123"/>
any ſin of his own, that Juſtice of it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to induce the obligation.</p>
            <p>XXVI. But leſt the Subject (too licentiouſly to
withdraw himſelf from the yoak of the Law) ſhould
give ſome pretence for his diſobedience (as it is a
wonder to ſee how many men do ſuffer themſelves
to be deceived by this paralogiſm) and ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
that the Law doth ſeem too unjuſt unto him,
and which with a good Conſcience he cannot obey,
&amp; therefore ought not to obey, for this they ſay
were to <hi>obey</hi> with a doubting Conſcience, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without Sin, as the Apoſtle, teacheth <hi>Rom. 14.
23. For whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin;</hi> It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
therefore in the ſixth place, to inquire farther,
and to demand, What certainty is required to know
whether <hi>any Law</hi> be unjuſt or not, that ſo a Subject
may be ſecure in his Conſcience whether he be
bound or not bound to the obſervation of it. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in the firſt place; If the Law be manifeſtly, &amp;
notoriouſly unjuſt, it is certain that the Subject is
not bound to the obſervation of it, which is alſo to
be affirmed, if by any <hi>moral certainty</hi> (after ſome due
diligence in ſearching out the Truth) he judgeth it to
be ſimply unjuſt. I ſay in the ſecond place; If out of
any confirmed Error of his Judgement, which it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
not eaſy for him to leave, he thinks the Law to be
unjuſt, when indeed it is not, yet for all that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in his mind, the obligation of the Law doth
ſtill remain, inſomuch that he is guilty of Sin, if
he doth not obey it; but ſhould Sin more grievouſly,
if, that Error not yet left off, he ſhould obey it; Of
this <hi>Caſe</hi> we ſhall have a greater opportunity to
ſpeak, when (if God ſhall permit) we ſhall come
to the Compariſon of both the ſorts of obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:154344:124"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I ſay in the third place; If out of ſome light
<hi>doubt</hi> or ſcruple he ſuſpects it may be ſo, that the
Law is unjuſt, that ſcruple is to be contemned, &amp; the
Law altogether to be obeyed, And no man under the
pretence of his tender Conſcience, is to excuſe him
ſelf from the neceſſity of giving obedience to it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> XVII. I ſay in the fourth place (And I would
to God that thoſe whoſe Cuſtom it is to defend
their groſſe diſobedience under the pretence of
their tender Conſciences, would give due attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it) If becauſe of ſome probable Reaſons
appearing on both ſides, the Subject cannot eaſily
determine with himſelf whether the Law be right
or not, inſomuch that his mind is in a great incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and knows not which way to incline, he is
bound in this caſe, <hi>actually</hi> to obey it, ſo that he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
if he obeyeth it not, and doth not ſin if he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it. My reaſon is; Firſt, Beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oſſidentis,
In doubtful things the Condition of the Poſſeſſor is the
better.</hi> Therefore when there is a Caſe at Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Law-maker, and the Citizen, unleſſe
there be ſome apparent reaſon to the contrary, it
is preſumed alwayes to be on the ſide of the Law-maker
againſt the Citizen, as being in the <hi>Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Right;</hi> But if there appears any ſound reaſon
to the contrary, the Caſe is altered, becauſe it is
againſt the ſuppoſition of Reaſon; for we then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that they contend in Law, one having as much
Right as the other. The ſecond Reaſon ariſeth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from another Rule of Law; <hi>In re dubia tutior pars
eſt eligenda, In a doubtful Caſe, the ſafer part is to be
choſen;</hi> And its ſafer to <hi>obey</hi> the Conſcience doubting,
than the Conſcience <hi>doubting not to obey;</hi> Becauſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:154344:124"/>
it is ſafer, in the honor due unto Superiors, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the mode that is due unto them, than to
be defective in it. The third Reaſon proceedeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
from the ſame Rule; for generally it is ſafer for a
Man to ſuppoſe himſelf to be obliged, when he is
free, than to ſuppoſe himſelf free, when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
obliged; For ſeeing by the inbred depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Heart of Man, we ſin oftner by too much
Boldneſſe, than by too much Fear, and are more
prone than it becomes us, to the licentiouſneſſe of
the Fleſh, and leſſe patient to bear the burthen,
unleſſe we were throughly before hand reſolved to
obey thoſe Laws which are not apparently unjuſt,
the <hi>Wiſdom of the fleſh,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Craft of the old Serpent,</hi>
would ſuggeſt unto us excuſes enough which would
retard and hinder us from the performance of our
Duties. And ſo much of the fourth doubt.</p>
            <p>XVIII. The fifth followeth; <hi>Of the permiſſive
Law of Evil;</hi> Wether it be lawful, and how
far lawful? And whether it be obligatory, and
how far obliging? Where in the firſt place we are
to obſerve; That an evil thing may three wayes
be admitted by the Law, that is to ſay, <hi>privative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
negatively, and poſitively.</hi> Privatively to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>permitted</hi> is the very ſame, which is <hi>pretermitted</hi> by
the Lawgiver; And in this ſenſe all thoſe things
are permitted, concerning the forbidding of which,
or the Puniſhing of which, the Laws do determine
nothing. That negatively is permitted, the excerciſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
whereof the Lawes do define and limit with certain
bounds, within which thoſe are ſafe and without
fault, who do contain themſelves, but thoſe who
do exceed them, are to be puniſhed by the Law;
And in this ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Laws of moſt Nations do
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154344:125"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> permit of <hi>Uſury.</hi> Thirdly, that is permitted
poſitively, the excerciſe whereof is tolerated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a certain pay of ſome Tribute; and thus houſes
of Incontinence are permitted at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIX. This diſtinction being permiſed; In the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt place I affirm, That <hi>privatively</hi> many Evils are
neceſſarily tolerated in all Common-wealths; for it
is impoſſible that the Laws ſhould extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to all the Species and kinds of vitious Acts, or
that all kind of Sin ſhould be reſtrained by humane
Laws; <hi>The Law of God</hi> hath this only which is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and peculiar to it ſelf, that it alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
all things that are to be done, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
all things that are to be avoyed. Now in
this permiſſion there is no place for obligation, for it
is neceſſary that every obligation ſhould ariſe from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſome <hi>Act,</hi> and not by the <hi>privation</hi> of <hi>an Act,</hi> or a
<hi>Non-Act.</hi> I ſay in the ſecond place, That the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
permiſſion of evil may be lawful; For if there
be ſome evils that cannot be quite taken away
without ſome great Inconvenience to the publick,
it pertaineth to the <hi>political prudence</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo to moderate the uſe of it, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it within certain bounds, as to make it
ſubſervient to the Publick profit; And this by the
Example of God himſelf, who permitted the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
of Wives to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to that
purpoſe, as Chriſt the moſt excellent Interpreter
of the Law expounds it,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Leſt by the hardneſſe of
their hearts, and the unbridled roughneſſe and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Husbands to their Wives, there ſhould ariſe</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>more grievous inconveniences.</hi> I ſay in the third
place; That by this Law, there is no man not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
obliged to perform that which this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:154344:125"/>
Law permitteth, for the end of permiſſion is, not
that that be done which by this Law is permitted,
but that nothing be done beyond that which the
ſaid Laws permit. Therefore as the permiſſion it
ſelf is only <hi>negative,</hi> ſo it induceth only a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
obligation; That is, the Subject is obliged
to do if he pleaſeth what the Law permitteth, and
not to exceed the bounds which that Law preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.
I ſay in the fourth place, That the poſitive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
permiſſion of Evil is not lawful, if there be more,
or more grievous Evils which follow that permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than thoſe are for the remedy whereof it was
pretended; eſpecially if to the permiſſion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of a filthy thing, there is added a ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of filthy lucre. I ſay in the fifth place, That
by ſuch a Law, no man is bound to the performance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
of that which is permitted, nay for all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of that Law, every man is obliged to a
non-performance; My Reaſon is, as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part; Becauſe it is againſt the Nature of a
<hi>permiſſion</hi> to oblige, for a permiſſion granteth Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and every obligation is a kind of a Bond.
As to the latter part, Becauſe we ſuppoſe that
what by the Law of man is ſo permitted, is of it
ſelf evil, and by the Law of God, we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not to do Evil; The permiſſion therefore of
Evil, as it is a bare permiſſion, doth oblige no
man to the performance, but as it is the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Evil, it doth oblige every man not to do
that which is permitted.</p>
            <p>XX. But it hath often heretofore been ſpoken,
that every Law hath a power obligative, which ſo
individually doth accompany it, as but to grant
the Law, the obligation muſt neceſſarily follow,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:154344:126"/>
and take away the obligation you take away alſo
the Law with it; It may therefore be objected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that we muſt hereupon either deny the permiſſive
Law to be a Law, or acknowlege it doth oblige.
To anſwer to this objection, we need not fly ſo
far as to deny the <hi>Law permiſſive</hi> to be a Law,
which we do acknowledge not only to be a Law,
but a Law properly ſo called; Certainly that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
Law of Divorce mentioned. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.
Though it comes by name of permiſſion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
in the eighth verſe, yet in the ſeventh verſe of
the ſame Chapter it is called a <hi>command,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
What, &amp; is not the very name of a Law eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where given to it, &amp; is not the Definition of that
name as congruous to it as to a <hi>Law</hi> either <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>forbidding</hi> ſomething to be done, ſo that it
cannot be denyed but that the Law is predicated of
them all <hi>univocally</hi> and as a <hi>Genus</hi> in reference to its
<hi>Species?</hi> it is not then to be granted, that the
Subject by this Law is obliged; I do ſo conceive
it altogether to be granted; which that it
may more rightly be underſtood to be not incohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
with thoſe things which have been already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of a <hi>permiſſive Law,</hi> I ſay in the ſixth place,
That every Law permiſſive, as it is a Law, doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Subject in his Conſcience to the obſervation
of it. The reaſon is manifeſt; for an obligation
(as often it hath been already ſpoken) is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
effect of the Law, and not to be ſevered
from it; Which that it may not ſeem to be quite
contrary to what now hath been delivered, theſe
two things are to be obſerved, which therefore
the more remarkably I ſhall give unto you; The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, that I ſaid the permiſſive Law doth oblige to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:154344:126"/>
the obſervation of it; Now it is one thing that the
Subject is obliged to the obſervation of the Law,
which I ſtill affirm, and another thing that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liged to do that which the Law permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
which I have before denyed, and do deny it ſtill.
The ſecond, that I ſaid the permiſſive Law as a Law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
doth oblige, which is true, but I did not ſay it did
oblige, as it was permiſſive, for that is falſe; becauſe
we are to know, that the force of a permiſſive Law,
as it is a Law, doth not conſiſt in the permiſſion it
ſelf, which being <hi>differentaa diviſiva,</hi> but a <hi>diviſive
difference</hi> of the Law, it muſt needs come in order
after it, as every <hi>difference diviſive</hi> is by nature in
a poſterior place to the <hi>Genus</hi> which doth divide it
and preſuppoſe it, but is for the moſt part expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or at leaſt virtually contained in that <hi>praeception</hi>
which is as it were the <hi>conſtitutive</hi> and <hi>formal</hi>
difference of the Law, and in the very words of the
Law it ſelf; For this preception is that from
whence the obligation of the Subject doth firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
and to which his obedience is ultimately ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated;
I will make it manifeſt unto you by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
By reaſon of the neceſſity of borrowing of
money, the maker of the Law permitteth of Uſury
in a moderate proportion amongſt the Citizens, a
puniſhment being denounced to thoſe who ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by taking more uſe than the Law allowes. I
will not here define whether Uſury be ſimply, and
in every kind of it, unlawful or not, neither doth it
belong to my preſent purpoſe, nevertheleſs this is
certain, that were it never ſo lawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no man
by that permiſſiou is obliged to the exerciſing of it,
But in this Law beſides this permiſſion which obliges
no man, there are two things which belonging to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:154344:127"/>
the Precept of the Law, have thereupon from the
Intention of the Law-giver a force of obliging the
Citizens to the obſervation of them; One whereof
is enjoyned formally and in expreſs words, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That no man exact monies beyond the allowance
preſcribed in the Law, the other virtually and by
Conſequence, That no man be puniſhed for trading
in uſury as it is by that Law permitted; To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
therefore in a word, the Precept or Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the permiſſive Law doth oblige all Subjects,
but the Permiſſion no man.</p>
            <p>XXII. The <hi>ſixth doubt</hi> is of things indifferent,
and of a middle nature; Now theſe things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
or of a middle nature are ſuch, all the <hi>Species</hi>
whereof are neither commanded nor forbidden by
any Divine Law, (natural, or poſitive.) They are
therefore of themſelves, and of their own nature,
lawfull to be obſerved as they are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and free to be obſerved as they are not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
There were ſome of an opinion that there ought
no Laws of man to be made concerning things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
but of thoſe things only which are of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or a divine right, and thereupon they ſaid, That
Civil Laws were not ſo much the Conſtitutives of
a new Law, as the Declaratives of the old, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
and evolutions of the Divine will; But
what need we to confute an opinion ſo abhorring
from all ſound reaſon, that rather to the contrary
we may rightly judge, that <hi>theſe things indifferent</hi>
are the moſt proper and the only moſt fit matter of
Humane Laws? For we are bound to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thoſe things which God hath commanded,
although the commands of all men whatſoever, are
either ſilent, or do contradict them; And as for thoſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:154344:127"/>
things which by God are forbidden, we are obliged
to the not performance of them, the Laws of men
being ſilent, or never ſo importunately command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. Therefore <hi>theſe things indifferent</hi> do
remain, as a large Field in which the power of man
might exerciſe it ſelf, and put forth its force by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
an obligation where there was none before.
That manifeſtly it may appear that the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
in things <hi>indifferent,</hi> and which before any
Act of his were <hi>free to both,</hi> may ſtate and decree
ſomething on either ſide, by determining that indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
which may oblige the Conſciences of his
Subjects to obedience; For as in Meat and Drink,
and Pleaſures, as alſo in <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving,</hi> the
<hi>moral prudence</hi> of a privare perſon, by allowing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelf a golden mediocrity, doth ſo far advance
his natural and indifferent Acts beyond their ſtate
and native Condition, that from thence they begin
to be Acts of Vertues, to wit, of <hi>Temperance,</hi> and
<hi>Liberality;</hi> ſo a perſon inveſted with the publick
Authority doth by his politick prudence in giving
certain bonds of mediocrity to his Subjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
things free, and of a middle nature, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
thoſe Acts enjoyned in his Laws beyond the
degree of their former State, that they now begin
to be Acts of virtues, to wit, of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIII. A thing moſt plain, and which would have
found no Adverſary, if ſo manifeſt a truth had not
preſtringed ſome Reformers of our age, nay, and
of our own Nation, who to make a way to that
wild Reformation for which they ſo much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
had rather againſt common ſence to take
away from the world all indifferency, than
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:154344:128"/>
to grant unto the Magiſtrate any power of determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Rites</hi> &amp; <hi>Laws,</hi> Altogether like that Macedonian
who with his Sword did cut that Gordian knot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
which by no Art he was able to untye; In
this, as in many other things the true Diſciples
of the old Stoicks, who aſſerted that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
indifferent to a wiſe man, but that he manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
all things from the greateſt to the leaſt, &amp; even
to the paring of his nayles, with the higheſt point of
diſcretion; But they ſo took away this <hi>indifferency
out of affairs</hi> with words only, that at laſt being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to it by the reaſons of their adverſaries, they
<hi>in deeds</hi> did grant it, having invented ſome frivolous
diſtinctions, more honeſtly to hide their errour, that
they might not ſeem to have erred at all. But there
have been found ſome amongſt us, who have been ſo
bold as to defend their odious, &amp; exploded Doctrine
in their publick writings, &amp; that more pertinaciouſly
than the Stoicks themſelves did heretofore. Two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
the one of them a <hi>Divine,</hi> a man of ſome
account amongſt thoſe of his own party, the other
a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> &amp; one of the Peers of the Land, both of
them now dead, with whom, becauſe I believe their
Doctrine to be dead alſo, and not eaſily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the belief of ſober men, much leſſe to
find a patron amongſt them, I think it not worth my
labour to inſiſt on the confutation of it.</p>
            <p>XXIV. I do receive therefore as granted, that
there are <hi>things</hi> and <hi>actions indifferent,</hi> at leaſt in
their own nature, and in the Species of them which
I believe there is no man ſo Stoicized that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Of which in reference to our preſent purpoſe,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>is is next to be advertiſed, that an Act indifferent
in its own nature, that is, in reſpect of the matter
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:154344:128"/>
or the object of it, if it be commanded by the Law,
from <hi>good and lawful,</hi> doth become <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi>
and if it be forbidden by the Law, from
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> it becomes <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>unlawful;</hi>
which come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not to paſſe by reaſon of any change
made of the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf, (which whether it be
commanded or forbidden, both <hi>phyſically,</hi> and
<hi>morally</hi> doth remain the ſame as it was before, for
there is no reſpect that alters nature) but proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from that obligation which the Law induceth;
From whence it is, that being before, both in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>of it ſelf,</hi> ſo alſo in <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>as to us,</hi> free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
both, the authority of the Law being added to it,
it becomes in the uſe of it, and as to us, no longer
free, but it is either neceſſary, or unlawful accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the exigence of the Law.</p>
            <p>XXV. If it be demanded, ſeeing the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
to have an equal power on either ſide, how
comes it to paſſe, that the Law by forbidding an
Act, can make it of being good and lawful, to
become evil, and unlawful, but the ſame Law,
(as heretofore we have denyed it) cannot by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
an Act, make it from being evil &amp; unlawful,
become good, and lawful; I anſwer, the reaſon
of the difference is moſt manifeſt, from that moſt
known <hi>Axiome, Bonum ex cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> integrâ, malum
ex quolibet defectu;</hi> An Act therefore that is evil in
its own Species, and in the reſpect of the object of
it, muſt of neceſſity be always evil, neither in any
exerciſing of it, be the circumſtances what they
will, may it be made good, by reaſon of the defect
of goodneſs <hi>in the part of the object,</hi> which defect is
ſufficient to corrupt the whole Act; But an Act,
good in its own kind, or at leaſt not evil, if it be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:154344:129"/>
but with ſome one circumſtance that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct,
it becometh wholy vitious, by reaſon of
the defect of a due rectitude in that circumſtance;
From whence ariſeth another difference betwixt an
<hi>affirmative,</hi> and a <hi>negative</hi> Humane Law, or a Law
commanding, or forbidding; For a Law affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
doth not give any <hi>goodneſs</hi> to the Act which it
commandeth, if it be otherwiſe evil in any part of
it; But a Law negative doth contribute <hi>evilneſſe</hi> to
the Act which it forbiddeth, although it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
good in every part of it; Or, which is the ſame
again, a Humane <hi>Precept affirmative</hi> doth make that
neceſſary which it finds to be good, a humane pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>negative</hi> doth make that unlawful which it
found to be good, both of them what they found
evil do leave it to be evil as they found it; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
both do oblige in their manner and as to
us, <hi>this,</hi> to the doing of that which by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is now made neceſſary, and <hi>that</hi> to the not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that which by forbidding is now made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
            <p>XXVI. The ſeventh Doubt remaineth of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Lawes in <hi>Special.</hi> By Lawes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
I do not underſtand thoſe Lawes which are
conſtituted by Eccleſiaſtical Perſons without the
Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate, (which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
pertains not to this caſe, but to a Cauſe of
an other kind, to wit, the Cauſe efficient) but thoſe
which, being made by any lawful Power, doe treat of
Eccleſiaſtical things, for at this preſent we diſpute
only of the <hi>material Cauſe.</hi> I have never heard of
any beſides thoſe two above named who denyed all
Indifferency, or who would not grant to the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Magiſtrate ſome Power in things indifferent,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:154344:129"/>
meerly political; But we meet every where with
a great number of Innovators, who would take
from men all Power of making Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in the publick worſhip of God, beſides
thoſe which are preſcribed by Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in the Goſpel; But ſincerely I profeſſe, that
to give ſatisfaction to my ſelf and to others in this
particular, Having peruſed many Books written by
many Authors, but eſpecially of our own Nation,
concerning this Subject, I find not any one, that
can produce any juſt or any likely Reaſon of <hi>Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
why there may not be a <hi>Power</hi> of ordaining
and determinating concerning things indifferent,
as well in Caſes Eccleſiaſtical as Political; For the
Arguments which are urged from <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Liberty</hi> and other common Places of the ſame
Nature doe equally fight againſt the Lawes, and
Conſtitutions of both Kinds, and do overthrow them
both, or neither of them. Thoſe which are thought
to carry a peculiar force againſt Eccleſiaſtical Laws
and Rites are four, which as the time will permit, I
will briefly, and orderly examine, they are derived
1. <hi>From Chriſt the Lawgiver; 2. From the perfection
of the Scripture; 3. From the nature of holy Worſhip;
4. From the example of the antient Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXVII. In the firſt place they object that of
the Apoſtle <hi>James, 4. 12. There is one Lawgiver
who can ſave and deſtroy;</hi> In the reign of <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
many who were the <hi>Coriphaei</hi> of that Diſciplinary
Faction did make very much of this argument as the
foundation of their whole Cauſe; They alleged
that Chriſt was the only Prince, and Legiſlator of
his Church; And the Laws which he made did
oblige the Church to a perpetual obſervation of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:154344:130"/>
them, and that no other Laws ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor any other Legiſlator acknowledged; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall preſume to make any other Lawes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe which Chriſt made, ſhall act the part of
Anti-Chriſt, and declare himſelf a raſh Invader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Office of Chriſt. We have diſcourſed on
this place, and expounded it already as occaſion
did require, eſpecialy where it was to be proved,
that God only and his Chriſt did exerciſe an
abſolute and a direct Command on the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Men; But that this hath no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
a place in Lawes politick, than in Eccleſiaſtick,
he muſt needs be blind that doth not obſerve it.
For why can the obligation of humane Laws in civil
things conſiſt with the legiſlative Power of Chriſt
alone, and why cannot there be the ſame conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
in Lawes Eccleſiaſtical? Who can diſcover
or produce the leaſt ſhadow of any difference from
that Text. Be Chriſt the Law-giver of the
Chriſtian Church, Is he not as well the Law-giver
of the Chriſtian Common-wealth? But the Apoſtle
in that place made not the leaſt mention of the
Church, nor inſtituted the leaſt diſputation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
things Eccleſiaſtical, neither doth he treat
there at all, of Political Lawes or Rites but of the
Cenſures of Private Men. He would have the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
admoniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to be mindf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l of Chriſtian Charity,
and that they ſhould forbear from paſſing a raſh
Judgment on their Brothers, for God was only
the Judge of Conſciences, who alone made that Law
by which every man in the laſt Day ſhall be judged.
This is the true ſcope of that place, This is the
mind of the Apoſtle. What is here I pray you, that
tendeth to the condemning of Humane Lawes? or
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:154344:130"/>
if to the condemning of them, why of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Lawes, more than Civil? Neither of which, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one, or the other, are aſſerted by us, by
themſelves, and of their own Vertue to oblige the
Conſcience.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. In the ſecond place they object the
Perfection of the Holy Scripture. This they ſay is
the Rule both of Life, and Manners, and which can
make a man of God wiſe to every good work, to
which if any man ſhall adde any thing of his own,
he ſhall commit a moſt remarkable treſpaſſe againſt
God, and pull moſt heavy puniſhments on himſelf.
All this is moſt certain: But if the Scripture in all
conſiderations be the abſolute rule of our lives, &amp; of
all things whatſoever to be done, and (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
theſe Stoicks) it extends to the ſlighteſt things,
inſomuch that it is not lawful to take up a ſtraw,
unleſſe it be by the preſcribed word of God, will
it not ſuffice as well for the regulating of things
Civil as Eccleſiaſtical? or how can the Laws of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he
Church derogate more from the perfection of the
Scripture, than the Laws of the Commonwealth?
or who is he who rightly can ſay that he hath added
ſomething to the word of God, who for Honeſty
and Orders ſake, did make the Eccleſiaſtical Laws,
ſeeing he propounded not his Laws unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as the word of God, and God in his word
hath commanded that all things in the Church ſhall
be done <hi>honeſtly</hi> and in <hi>order?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIX. In the third place they object the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of worſhip, to wit, that the worſhip of God
is a thing ſacred, in which worſhip all things are to
be done by the Command of God, and all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
inventions are to be driven far away as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:154344:131"/>
nay plainly Idolatrous, and traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Rites;</hi> Indeed the worſhip of God is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
thing, neither is it lawful for man to inſtitute
any other worſhip beſides that which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
But becauſe there is an Ambiguity in the
word, we are to diſtinguiſh of the worſhip of
God, which is taken in a threefold conſideration;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt of all, the worſhip of God properly ſo
called, and the chiefeſt, is that inward wordſhip
of the mind, which conſiſteth in the exerciſe of
inward Vertues, as of <hi>Faith, Hope, Love, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Confidence, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Acts by which that inward worſhip of the
mind is partly expreſſed, and partly helped, and
foſtered, ſuch as are <hi>publick Prayers, Singing of
Pſalms,</hi> the <hi>Hearing of the word,</hi> and the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of the Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> may <hi>reducibly,</hi>
and leſſe <hi>properly</hi> be called, and oftentimes are
called the <hi>worſhip of God,</hi> as they are the outward
Teſtimonies and Helps of that worſhip which ſo
properly is called. Thirdly, Seeing it is impoſſible
that any outward action, eſpecially if it be a ſolemn
one, ſhould be performed without ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
either more, or leſſe, of <hi>Time, Place,</hi> and
<hi>Gesture,</hi> from whence it comes to paſſe, that the
very ſame Circumſtances (which if eſtabliſhed by
<hi>Laws or Cuſtomes,</hi> are called alſo <hi>Rites</hi>) do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
receive the appellation of worſhip, although
very improperly, and only for that Concomitancy
which they have to that outward worſhip, which
it ſelf alſo is improperly called a worſhip. It is
therefore to be affirmed, That the <hi>inward primary
worſhip,</hi> &amp; properly ſo called, doth only ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God to be the only Author of it, that it is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:154344:131"/>
not lawful for any man either to inſtitute a new
worſhip, or being inſtituted by God, to exhibit it
to any other beſides God himſelf. We are to
affirm alſo, That the outward worſhip, according to
its <hi>ſubſtantials,</hi> is inſtituted only by God; but
there is a far different account to be made of the
circumſtances which are acceſſary to this outward
worſhip, and thoſe which do accompany it, If there
be any who will Honor them alſo with the Name
of worſhip. For ſeeing that the outward worſhip
of God cannot be performed without Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and God in the Goſpel hath not given any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
particular Circumſtances perpetually to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in ſacred Aſſemblyes, but only hath lay'd
down ſome Generals as may conduce to Order,
Honeſty, and Edification, it muſt neceſſarily
follow, that the Determination of the ſaid Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
which are but <hi>Accidental</hi> to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
it ſelf, and mutable according to the reſpect
of Times, Places, and Occaſions, muſt pertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe, who under Chriſt have a Right and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Governing the Churches, which that they may
be impoſed by thoſe, who in the ſeveral Churches
are inveſted with publick Authority, and being
impoſed, may Religiouſly be obſerved by all the
Members of the ſaid Churches; the nature of Holy
worſhip doth not forbid, but Solemnity rather, &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
doth require; We obſerve alſo, that even
thoſe Men themſelves who ſo Lordly &amp; bitterly do
inveigh againſt the Canons, and Eccleſiaſtical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
yet as often as they pleaſe, do uſe thoſe
Rites in the outward worſhip of God no where
preſcribed by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, as the lifting
up of their hands in the taking of an Oath, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:154344:132"/>
of the Head in the Holy Conventions, and
many other things, which becauſe we dayly obſerve
to be done, it is unneceſſary to rehearſe them.</p>
            <p>XXX. In the fourth place they object, that
<hi>Moſes,</hi> the pattern of the old, that is, of the
Jewiſh Church, who was given by God to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Jews to be their Lawgiver, did not only
by his Law define the <hi>Subſtantials</hi> of the Jewiſh
worſhip, but according to that fidelity which was
in him, he omitted not the leaſt Circumſtances,
and in building the Tabernacle which was to be a
Type of the Chriſtian Church, he moſt compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perfectly finiſhed all things according to the
<hi>Idaea</hi> of the Example which was propounded to
him in the Mount; And now if Chriſt the-Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the new Teſtament ſhould not have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
all things, and every thing even to the leaſt
Circumſtances which are to be performed in the
Eccleſiaſtical worſhip, it may juſtly be believed
(to ſuſpect which is near to Blaſphemy) that he
was leſſe faithful in the Houſe of God than <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and thereupon there is a remarkable injury and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely
done unto Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if any new Rites never
inſtituted by him ſhould by humane Authority be
brought into the Church, or be received by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
common people. But they who do object theſe
things, ought in the firſt place to have conſidered
that by this Argument, all humane political Laws
are no leſſe everted than Ecleſiaſtical, for <hi>Moſes</hi> by
the commandement of God did give unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a certain, and a defined Law, not
only of thoſe Rites which belonged to the worſhip
of God, but alſo of thoſe Decrees, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which belonged to the Adminiſtration of
Civil Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:154344:132"/>
XXXI. In the ſecond place, it is a wonder
moreover, that they obſerved not that by this
compariſon of that fidelity which was in both Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers,
<hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, that they could not
more importunately have alleged any thing that
could bring a greater dammage to their own Cauſe,
or more ſtrongly have confirmed ours; For, as
from that, that <hi>Moſes</hi> both in <hi>rituals</hi> and <hi>judicials</hi>
did give many Laws unto the people of the Jews,
we do truly collect it was the will of God, that
the people of the Jews ſhould be ſo reſtrained in
their duties under that paedagogy, and <hi>Moſaick</hi>
Diſcipline, as under a Yoak of ſervitude, ſo that
very few things ſhould be free unto them; ſo from
that alſo, that Chriſt the moſt faithful Interpreter of
his Fathers Will, did give unto the Chriſtian
Church but a very few Laws of Ceremonies, we do
truly collect that it is the will of God, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and Chriſtian people, ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in thoſe things to their own Liberty, ſo that
it is now free for any private Man of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
(no command, or prohibition of a ſuperior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening)
to do as ſhall ſeem in his own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be moſt expedient, and to the ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and their Governors, to preſcribe thoſe things
which according to the condition of the time
and place ſhall ſeem to them to be moſt ſubſervient
to Order, Honeſty, Edification, and Peace.</p>
            <p>XXXII. Moreover, Thoſe who do make uſe of
this Argument, ought in the third place to have
conſidered, that under that Paedagogy of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
the Jews themſelves had not all the Liberty of
Rites in things pertaining to the worſhip of God ſo
take away, that it was not lawful for them by their
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:154344:133"/>
own Authority, to obſerve and to inſtitute thoſe
things, which it is manifeſt were never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either by God himſelf or by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Servant.
Of many take theſe few inſtances; Firſt, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
feaſt of the Paſſover which by the Law of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded ſhould be obſerved but
ſeaven dayes, was by a ſpecial Law of <hi>Hezekias</hi>
(who received a ſingular teſtimony of his piety
from God himſelf) and by the conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
continued ſeaven dayes longer; The Hiſtory
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is extant 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. Secondly <hi>Eſther</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay</hi>
did inſtitute that the ſeaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> ſhould
be yearly celebrated in memory of that Deliverance
which God vouchſafed to the Nation of the Jewes
under <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> King of the Perſians, <hi>Eſther.</hi> 9.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly when <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded but one day only
in the year to be obſerved in the ſeaventh month
for a ſolemn Faſt, the Kings and Magiſtrates of
that people (for what cauſes it is not known, but
likely in the remembrance of ſome remarkable
Judgements of God) did by their own Authority
inſtitute annual ſolemn Faſts, inſomuch, that in
the dayes of the laſt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Prophets, there were
four ſolemn Faſts kept every year, <hi>viz,</hi> three
others beſides that of the ſeventh month, in
the fourth, fifth, and tenth month, of all which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> mention is made, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 19. Fourthly, the Feaſt
of the Dedication of the Altar, called <hi>Encoenia,</hi>
was inſtituted by the <hi>Aſamonians</hi> without any
command of God; The Hiſtory is to be read;
<hi>Maccab.</hi> 4. 59. And by the Judgement of the moſt
and beſt Interpreters, Chriſt himſelf is thought not
only to have approved of it, but to have honoured
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it with his preſence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 20. Fifthly, we find it no
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:154344:133"/>
where to be enjoyned by any Commandment of
God, that in ſolemn <hi>Faſts</hi> and penitential mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they ſhould put on Sack-cloth, and ſtrew
Aſhes on their hair, but amongſt the Jews for
ſome Ages paſt, the long cuſtom was ſo received,
and ſo obtained the force of a Law, that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
did uſe that manner of Speech, as from the
cuſtom of that Nation, and ſhowed not the leaſt
diſlike of it; <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 21. Sixthly, it is manifeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
by the writings of the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> that it was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
alſo of the Jews before the ſupper of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that the Maſter of the Family ſhould ſtoop
ſolow, as to waſh the feet of thoſe of his own
houſhold, which although commanded by no Law
of God, we find it to be obſerved by Chriſt, as it
is manifeſt in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 13.
Why ſhall I here number up the Synagogues every
where builded in ſo many Cities, and Towns, for
the Conveniency of ſacred Conventions, and many
other things, a long Catalogue, whereof the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Commentaries doe afford us; From all which
this may be concluded, If ſo many things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the worſhip of God were lawful for the Jews
to alter under that yoak of Severer Diſcipline,
there can no probable Argument be derived from
their Example to overthrow the force of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Humane Laws.</p>

Concerning the obligation of humane

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt Term we did treat of
the obligation of humane Laws,
both in the <hi>Generality of</hi> them, to
wit, that Laws rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
do oblige the Conſciences of
the Subjects to obedience, ſo alſo
in the <hi>Species</hi> as to thoſe doubts which ſeemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to pertain to the material cauſe, to wit, how
humane Laws do oblige them. Firſt, we treated of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:154344:134"/>
things impoſſible; Secondly, of things poſſible but
very burthenſome; Thirdly, of things neceſſary;
Fourthly, of things unlawfull and diſhoneſt; Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of Evils to be permitted; Sixthly, of Things of
a middle Nature, &amp; indifferent in general; Seventhly,
of Eccleſiaſtical Rites in Special; of all theſe things
which have been ſpoken (that I may not appear too
tedious in repetition) the Sum is this; That Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are obliged to obey juſt Laws, but they are
not obliged to obey Laws that are unjuſt; And ſo
<hi>Solomon</hi> in this Text requireth of the makers of
Laws, that they do decree nothing but what is juſt.
I muſt now proceed to proſecute thoſe things
which are yet remaining to be ſpoken of; In the
handling of which I will uſe as much brevity as the
ſubject will permit, that ſo in its due time I may
finiſh the whole work, or at leaſt ſo much of it as
pertaineth to the obligation of Laws.</p>
            <p>II. In the order of Cauſes (according to the
method which I have elſewhere obſerved) the
Efficient Cauſe doth follow next to the Material;
And the Formal next to that, the Final Cauſe is the
laſt of all, and doth both head the Rear, and ſhuts
it up. Concerning the Efficient Cauſe of Laws,
I have already ſufficiently ſhewed, in the <hi>third
Concluſion of the fifth Lecture,</hi> That humane Lawes
do not oblige unleſs they are made by a perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with a legitimate Authority. This in the
firſt place is now remaining to be conſidered of, In
whom is the juſt and lawful power of making of
Laws, or who are thoſe makers of Laws, to whom
according to the mind of <hi>Solomon,</hi> The Right of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
righteous things belongeth. To give a full
Anſwer to this firſt <hi>doubt,</hi> which is the chiefeſt of all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:154344:135"/>
by farr in this kind of Cauſe, two things are to be
ſuppoſed; In the firſt place, I ſuppoſe the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power, to be the power of a Superior, as to give
a Command (in which appellation, I do alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a <hi>Prohibition</hi>) which is a proper <hi>Act</hi> of the
Law, to be the Act of a Superior. You are to obſerve,
that in this conſideration there is not a little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt theſe three; <hi>A Promiſe, A Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>a Command.</hi> Without the leaſt diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is common to all <hi>Superiors, Inferiors,</hi> and
<hi>Equals,</hi> to promiſe; For a Father may promiſe
ſomething to his Son, and the Son to the Father,
and the Brother, or a Neighbour, to his Brother, or
to his Neighbour; But to Crave, or to Petition,
belongeth properly to Inferiors, and ſometimes
in ſome reſpect to <hi>Equals,</hi> As the Son beſeecheth
his Father, or the Neighbour his Neighbour, to
excuſe him, or to receive the acknowledgment of
his thankfulneſſe, but this belongeth not unto Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
unleſſe it be very improperly, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
to a lower degree than their condition is;
But it is ſo peculiar to Superiors, and of Men pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a preheminence of Dignity to Command,
that he would be altogether ridiculous whoſoever
he is, whether an <hi>Equal</hi> or an <hi>Inferior,</hi> that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſhould command his <hi>Superior</hi> or <hi>Equal</hi> to the
performance of any thing; For every <hi>Act</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a <hi>Beginning proportionated to it, And an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
hath no Command on an Equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. Now as to an obligation concerning theſe
three, it is thus to be Stated; He who craveth
one thing of another man, obligeth by that
petition, neither himſelf, nor the party of whom
he craveth it: for it is a petition, and a petition is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:154344:135"/>
an Act of Indigence, and not of power, whoſe
<hi>effect,</hi> becauſe it depends on another, and proceeds
not from the Agent it ſelf, cannot induce any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.
But he who promiſeth ſomething to
another man, doth by his promiſe oblige himſelf,
but he obligeth not him to whom the promiſe is
made; for a promiſe being the Act of a free will,
every man as he is a <hi>free Agent,</hi> and hath a power
over his own will, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 37. can exerciſe on himſelf that
Right and Power which he hath over his own will,
but not on another; For by the force of <hi>Free will,</hi>
a man is maſter only of his own will, and of his own
Acts, and not of anothers; Now on the contrary,
he who layes a precept upon, or who doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
another, if he hath right to command, he
obligeth by commanding that man whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
but he doth not oblige himſelf; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a command is an Act of power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and of <hi>right</hi> upon another; and is fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
unleſs peradventure there be ſomething that
hinders it, to induce an obligation; ſo the Father
with Authority commands the Son, the Maſter the
Servant, the General the Souldier, the King the
people, and God as a Superior commandeth
man to ſuch and ſuch duties, and by commanding
doth oblige him to the performance of them.</p>
            <p>IV. In the ſecond place I ſuppoſe, that the
Legiſlative power is a power of publick Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for it ſufficeth not to the power of making
Laws, that a man hath a Right, and power over
others to preſcribe unto them what is to be done,
unleſs he be inveſted with an external power to
compel them to the performance of it, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:154344:136"/>
puniſhments on the Refuſers; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle, Ethick.</hi> 10.
The Law hath a neceſſitating power; The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
therefore do diſtinguiſh that power which a
Superior hath over an Inferior, into that power
which they call <hi>Dominative,</hi> or the power of
Maſterdome, and the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> The
firſt whereof is leſs and more private, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
an external Juriſdiction, the other greater
and of a more inforcing Authority. Theſe two
powers do not a little differ between themſelves,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and that in a three-fold conſideration. Firſt in
reſpect of the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>object,</hi> for the <hi>Power Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative</hi>
or of maſtery, is properly exerciſed on
the more imperfect and private Commonalty,
as a Houſe, a School, or a Family, but the power
of Juriſdiction on the more perfect and publick
Commonalty, as a City, an Army, a Common-wealth.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly in reſpect of the <hi>End,</hi> for the
power Dominative, by it ſelf, and Primarily is
ordinated to the profit of the perſon indued with
that power, that is the maſter, and but Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arily
and by Conſequence to the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,
as it is profitable for a Family that the
maſter of it ſhould grow rich; Now the power of
publick Juriſdiction is Primarily ordinated to the
publick good of the Commonalty it ſelf, and but
Secondarily, and Conſequently to the good of the
perſon indued with that power, which is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
himſelf, it being profitable for a Prince
that the Common-wealth ſhould flouriſh. Thirdly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in the reſpect of the more effectual Adminiſtration,
which is greater in the <hi>power of juriſdiction</hi> than
in the <hi>Power Dominative,</hi> by reaſon of a greater
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:154344:136"/>
coactive Power; for examples ſake, The Maſter
of a Family cannot ſo efficaciouſly prevail that his
Commands may be put in Execution by his Sons,
or Servants, whom he cannot correct but with a rod,
or Cudgel, as may the civil Magiſtrate, who by
his Power may enforce his Subjects to Obedience,
by impriſonment or baniſhment, by confiſcating
their Goods, or by Death it ſelf; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
The fatherly Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath nothing in it that is enforcing, nothing that is
neceſſating, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the place newly quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Therefore to the making of Laws every ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
is not ſufficient, but beſides that <hi>Dominative,</hi>
there is required the power of Juriſdiction ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called, for the Laws cannot be made or eſtabliſhed,
unleſs by a Perſon that hath a publick coactive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
by this time you underſtand I believe (that I may
need no more to admoniſh you of it) that what here
hath been ſpoken by me concerning Laws, doth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
pertain to the chief Laws of a Nation, and not
to any others unleſs <hi>analogically,</hi> &amp; after their way &amp;
the proportion that is due unto them, as they come
near or are more remote from their perfection.</p>
            <p>V. To theſe two ſuppoſitions (which to what
ſenſe they tend, you ſhall eaſily underſtand from
thoſe things which preſently I ſhall repreſent unto
you) I in the third place do now adde a <hi>reſponſive</hi>
poſition, <hi>viz. That the power Legiſlative is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
autocra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ical,</hi> That is, the power of making Laws,
which may oblige the Commonalty, doth conſiſt in
him alone (whether he be a ſingle perſon, as in the
ſtate of Monarchical Government, or whether they
be more, as in other Governments) who exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the chief power over the whole Commonalty;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:154344:137"/>
I will in the firſt place explane this poſition, and
afterwards I will confirm it; And for the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it we are in the firſt place to underſtand, that
for the happineſs of humane ſocieties, and the more
commodious Adminſtration of Commonwealths,
it hath pleaſed Almighty God, the Author of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
not only to conſtitute a political Government,
that there may be Magiſtrates to be ſet over the
people, but alſo in that very Government to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
a political Order, that amongſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
themſelves there might be divers degrees, as
well of Dignity, as of Power; And it is likely that
the military word of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
uſeth in the <hi>Romans,</hi> hath a relation to this
ſence, to ſhow that there is not only an ordination
of Magiſtrates from God, but a ſubordination alſo,
ſuch as is ſeen in a military Army.</p>
            <p>VI. In the ſecond place we are to know, that in
all things in which there is <hi>order,</hi> to avoid a <hi>proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to an <hi>infiniteneſſe,</hi> which Nature doth abhor,
we muſt at the laſt come neceſſarily to ſomething
which is the firſt and chiefeſt in that Order, where
we are to make a ſtand. Therefore ſeeing that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of the ſame Commonalty are ſome of
them ſuperiour unto another in Dignity and power,
it muſt of neceſſity ſo come to paſſe, that ſome one
of them muſt be tranſcendent above the reſt, that the
others may depend on him, and he on none; In the
ſame conſtruction, the head is the higheſt in the
body, the Admiral in a Fleet, and the Emperour
in an Army. The ſupreme Magiſtrate is only leſs
than God himſelf, and in governing the people
committed to his charge, hath neither a <hi>Superiour</hi>
nor an <hi>Equal;</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls him <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>VII. In the third place we are to know, that
this <hi>ſupreme power,</hi> which we call Majeſty, or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocratical,</hi>
that is governing all by it ſelf, according
to the diverſe form of Commonwealths, is placed
either in ſome one perſon, or in more; In a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſtate which is called <hi>Democraty,</hi> the chief and
Soveraign power conſiſteth in many Magiſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es,
yearly choſen by popular Suffrages, or by certain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Intervalls of time, and this heretofore was the
ſtate of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they were govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Conſulls, Praetors, Tribunes of the people,
Aedils and other yearly Magiſtrates, and from hence
proceed thoſe Expreſſions which oftentimes we find
in <hi>Tully, Populi Romani Majeſtas, laeſa populi Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtas,
Viſum eſt Senatui, populo<expan>

Majeſty of the Romane people, The injured Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
of the people; it ſeemed good to the Senate, and
the people of Rome &amp;c.</hi> In a ſtate <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> the
ſame Majeſty reſideth amongſt ſome of the Lords,
and Nobles, whom in ſome places they call <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſimoes,</hi>
in others the Peers of the Land, and in
other places again, they receive other titles and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations,
according to the cuſtom of the Nation;
Amongſt whom, although peradventure but one
(as in the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi>) or more of
them may have a preheminence of place and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:154344:138"/>
above the reſt, being as it were <hi>a certain Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Order</hi> (which heretofore was the Honour of the
Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome Patriarchs in their
Councils) yet no man was ſo ſuperiour above the
reſt in power, that by his own authority he could
judge any one of them, neither could he himſelf
be judged unleſſe it were by all of them altogether;
Some form of this Government is ſtill retained by
our Mayors and Aldermen in our Cities, and by
the Heads and Fellows of Colleges in our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
and although as it were but in a ſhadow, yet
in ſome manner they do repreſent it to us; But in
a Monarchial Government (as the Name it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies)
the chief Power is reſident in the Perſon of
the King alone, whereupon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Interpreter of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> doth admoniſh the
Chriſtian People to obey the King, as their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
that no man might any more doubt of whom
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh when he maketh mention of the
<hi>higher Powers Ro. 1. 3. 1. Samuel</hi> alſo the Prophet
of God doth ſo propound unto the people the fulneſs
of the Kingly Power to be conſidered of, by them, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 8. That if a King, the ſupreme in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſhould act all thoſe things which in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is manifeſt that it is lawful for him to do, upon
no juſt Cauſe but upon the meer deſire of Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to ſhow himſelf a Tyrant, and not a King,
although he wanted not Sin before God, yet he
ought not to have any force to be put upon him by
the People, nevertheleſs he may juſtly be ſaid to
have <hi>abuſed his Power</hi> but <hi>his own Power.</hi> Amongſt
us Engliſh, what more certainly or more cleerly can
appear (unleſs at noon we chooſe rather to be blind
than open our eyes) than that the ſupreme Power
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:154344:138"/>
of the three Kingdoms doth intirely appertain to
the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, whom we are
accuſtomed to render more remarkable by the title
of Majeſty, not only according to the common uſe
of ſpeaking, but in our ſolemn Ordinances, and in
all our forms &amp; actions of Law, &amp; in the taking of an
oath, laying our hands upon the Goſpel of the eternal
God we acknowledg <hi>him</hi> the ſupreme yea &amp; the
only ſupreme Governour of all perſons and Cauſes
in his Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>VIII. In the fourth place we are to underſtand,
That when we ſay, the Power of making Lawes is
in the King alone, It is not ſo to be underſtood,
as if we meant that whatſoever the King is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to command ſhall immediatly obtain the force
of a Law, for by and by I will ſhow unto you that
ſome Conſent of the People themſelves, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things are required to the Conſtitution of
Law, but this is that, which I would hold forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that the Counſels of the People &amp; Senate,
and other Demands of the Peers, People, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
whomſoever, doe not oblige the Subjects, nor
do carry with them the Power of a Law, unleſſe
they are ſtrengthened and eſtabliſhed by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the King, to which being maturely and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepared, as ſoon as the Conſent of the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
they immediatly receive the Name, the
Form, and Authority of a Law, and forthwith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
as ſoon as they are publiſhed, to oblige the
Subjects; Therefore, ſeeing that only is to be
eſteemed to be the <hi>Principal</hi> and the <hi>efficient,
Cauſe</hi> of any thing, which by it ſelf, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
produceth, and into a prepared matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth
that Form which giveth to that Thing
both the <hi>Name</hi> and the <hi>Being,</hi> although other things
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:154344:139"/>
ought to concurre to the production of that Effect,
or to go before it as ſo many praevious diſpoſitions,
that ſo the matter may be rendred more apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Form intended by the Agent, It is moſt
manifeſt, whatſoever thoſe things are which antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
are required to the Conſtitution of a Law,
yet the will of the Prince, from whoſe Arbitration
and Command alone, all <hi>Rogations</hi> of Lawes are
either eſtabliſhed, or made void, is the only adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate,
and efficient Cauſe of Publick Laws.</p>
            <p>IX. Theſe things being premiſed, The Poſition is
confirmed by many Arguments, And firſt by the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
of Holy Scripture; Firſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. in that
remarkable Teſtament of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> being
about to dye, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not be taken away
from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-giver from his Thigh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is a
Prophecy of the future Royal Dignity of that Tribe,
which the holy old man doth periphraſtically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
and to the Confirmation of it, he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the <hi>Scepter,</hi> the moſt remarkable witneſſe of
Kingly Authority, and the Legiſlative Power the
chiefeſt Perogative of it: Secondly <hi>Deut. 33. 4,
5. Moſes</hi> was ſaid to be a King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe
having gathered together all the Tribes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he gave them a Law to obſerve. Thirdly <hi>Pſal.
60. 7. Judah is my Law-giver,</hi> that is, King. And
the vulgar Interpretation reads it, <hi>Judah</hi> is my
King. In the Text now in hand, <hi>Prov. 8. 15. By
me Kings reign, and the makers of Laws do decree
juſt things,</hi> where (which is uſual with <hi>Solomon</hi> in
the whole Book of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that the latter part
of the verſe doth contain an Amplification or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis)
the very ſame Perſons who in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the verſe are called Kings, in the latter
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:154344:139"/>
part by way of Amplification are called, <hi>Makers</hi> of
<hi>Lawes.</hi> Fiftly, In the new Teſtament St. <hi>James</hi>
alſo maketh mention <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Royal Law.</p>
            <p>X. Secondly, It is confirmed by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Philoſophers, and Hiſtorians, and by the
Authority of the Civil Laws, and the municipal
Laws of our Nation. The thing being ſo manifeſt
we ſhall be content to give you but few Examples;
<hi>Ariſtotle, Plutarch,</hi> and almoſt an infinit Number
of other Authors of great Eſtimation do all affirm,
that we muſt have a Law, and the <hi>Law of the
Prince;</hi> But that of <hi>Ulpian,</hi> is very remarkable
which he hath in his Book of the Roman Laws;
<hi>Quod principi placuit Legis vigorem habet; What
pleaſeth the Prince hath the force and Vigor of a
Law;</hi> which leſt it may ſeem to make a way for
tyrannical Domination being ill underſtood, hath
heretofore been thus expounded by our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Bracton, What pleaſeth the Prince,</hi> that is, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing which headily and out of the heat of his
troubled mind is ſuddenly conceived, and reſolved
upon, but that which by the Counſel of his Peers,
(his Royal Aſſent giving Authority unto it) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
and a debate being had thereon, ſhall
maturely and rightly be defined.<note place="margin">Cui <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> legibus ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis legum vim impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem Deus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. <hi>Finch. Nomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. in Epiſt. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.</hi>
               </note> And in our Laws,
In the dayly proceedings in our Courts of <hi>Pleas,</hi>
the Laws, according to the ſolemn Form of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
are called the <hi>Kings Lawes,</hi> for no other
Cauſe, as our Lawyers have informed us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are the Fountains of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and Laws, and (the Laws themſelves in
the reading of them profeſſing it) becauſe from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God they have granted to them an <hi>autocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
or a ſelf-Ruling Power of giving force unto
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:154344:140"/>
the Laws themſelves, that they may paſſe for, and be
eſteemed as Laws; This is ſo plain, that we need not
take any further pains in producing more witneſſes.</p>
            <p>XI. And indeed this were enough, and might give
abundant ſatisfaction, were it not for the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of an idle perſon that conceals his own Name,
who by a ruinous and a naſty fiction, and which
was never heard off in the world before theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
times, hath endeavoured to caſt a miſt over ſo
clear a light, by raiſing an Invention of I know not
what <hi>coordinate Power:</hi> And to flatter the nefarious
Counſels and Endeavours of ſome <hi>Neotericks</hi> in
theſe dayes, which being deſtitute of all defence of
Right, were nevertheleſs for the time to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by ſome ſpecious pretence although never ſo
weak and ſlender, he doth in a Book publiſhed for
that purpoſe, earneſtly labour to make the people
ſenſible of that wild Philoſophy which hither
to had been impoſed on them by way of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
viz. <hi>That the King being ſupreme and
having no equal, is notwithſtanding at the ſame
time not ſupreme, and hath an equal:</hi> yet is it
not ſo much to be admired, as lamented,
that there were found ſome who greedily
ſnatched at and imbraced this ridiculous Invention,
as ſlid down from heaven, and indeed becauſe it
concerned their Intereſt, that the people ſhould
be ſeduced into ſuch a falſe Belief, they therefore
ſuffered themſelvs to be ſo inſnared by this groſſe
<hi>Sophiſm,</hi> as to become guilty of the fouleſt Perjury:
For what can deſerve to be called Perjury, if this
be not Perjury in the higheſt Nature? As to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
and conſtitute a Power equal to him in
his Kingdom, whom in expreſſe words you have
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:154344:140"/>
ſworn to be the only and the ſupreme Power in the
Kingdom. Away then with this our ſo abſurd <hi>Coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi>
and with all his portentuous Jugglings, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo cleanly rid our hands of him, let us proceed.</p>
            <p>XII. The ſaid poſition or Concluſion is thirdly
proved by reaſon; the chiefeſt Act of Governing
doth require the chiefeſt Power, for every Act being
the exerciſe of ſome Power doth preſuppoſe in the
Agent a Power proportionate to it; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the
making of Laws is the ſupreme, &amp; chief Act of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning;
It cannot therfore be excerciſed unleſs by a
perſon who is inveſted himſelf, or who by his virtue
and authority doth derive unto another the ſupreme
power and juriſdiction over the Commonalty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to him; For ſeeing there are two moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts and Species of juriſdiction and publick
power, and remarkable above the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
power,</hi> and the <hi>power Judicial,</hi> both of
which conſiſt in <hi>jure dicundo,</hi> that is in pronouncing
the Law, from whence the name of juriſdiction doth
proceed, but with this difference, that the <hi>juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Judge,</hi> is the ſpeaking of a Law only as it
is already given, or exhibited, but the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of
the <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> is the ſpeaking of a Law that is as
yet unmade, and remaineth ſtill to be exhibited,
it followeth, that the power of the Judge is
far more narrow, and not of ſuch a noble extenſion
as that of the Law-giver. It is the office of the
Judge to ſpeak and give Laws unto the people by a
Law already made, but it is the office of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
to give Laws unto the Judge himſelf, and
to ordain a new Law which may be a Rule unto him
in his ſeat of Judicature; the Judge is obliged to
<hi>pronounce</hi> according to the preſcript of the Law
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:154344:141"/>
conſtituted, The Law-giver out of the plenitude
of his power doth preſcribe and conſtitute the Law,
which the inferiour Judge is no leſſe bound for the
future to obſerve than the people themſelves; It
is therefore no wayes inexpedient that the judicial
power being a power of an inferiour nature be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
exerciſed by an inferiour perſon, but it is as
neceſſary as expedient, that the <hi>ſupreme</hi> &amp; <hi>architecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi>
power of making Laws ſhould be excerciſed by
none but only by that perſon who hath in his hands
the ſupreme power; and ſo much of the firſt Doubt.</p>
            <p>XIII. The ſecond demand or Quaere is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the conſent of the people be required to the
obligation of the Law? For by what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſpoken, a man may peradventure conceive,
that the power of making Laws doth pertain unto
a Prince by ſo abſolute and full a power, that the
Subjects have no part in this great affair, and in
whatſoever he determineth there remaineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for the people to do but to perform his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and to humble their necks under the yoak of
his obedience; And indeed according to the luſts
of thoſe who heretofore bore ſway, it may appear
by their <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo,</hi> that this exceſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
did take ſuch place amongſt the Kings of
former ages, when the meer arbitrations of Princes
ſtood for Laws, that the name of a Tyrant, of an
innocent, at the firſt, and of an honeſt ſignification,
did grow at the laſt into a great ignominy by the foul
abuſe of ſo ſaving a power, and even in our days
it doth convey ſomthing that is horrid into our
ears as often as we hear it ſpoken. But that ſome
conſent of the people is at leaſt required, I have both
heretofore manifeſted, and it is granted by all of
the moſt approved Authors that I have read; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:154344:141"/>
much that the Jeſuits themſelves, the moſt ſtout De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of the Popes <hi>oecumenical</hi> omnipotence, and
which by them is by no limits to be included, do yet
hold, that many in <hi>Germany</hi> and other places are to
be excuſed for the non-obſerving of the Laws of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Bulls of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi>
only upon this Account, that thoſe Laws were
never received into uſe amongſt thoſe Nations; I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
therefore, and it is the common received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the Laws propounded and inſtituted by a
Prince, or the Head of a Commonalty, do not
oblige the Subjects, nor have the Power of a Law,
unleſs they be received by the Commonalty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and are allowed by the Cuſtoms and Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of thoſe that uſe them. According to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi>
the Law is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ingagement</hi> of a City, and if peradventure his
authority be of leſſe value, becauſe he lived in the
popular Common wealth of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> will
you be pleaſed to hear the great Lawyer <hi>Julian,</hi> who
lived when the Roman Emperours had the fulneſs
of command? his words in his two and thirtieth
Book <hi>de legib.</hi> are theſe, <hi>Ipſae Leges nulla alia ex
cauſa nos tenent quam quod judicio populi receptae ſunt,
The Laws do oblige us for no other cauſe, than that
they are received by the judgement of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIV. But though all acknowledge the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that reception or conſent, yet all men do not
derive it from the ſame Fountain. There are ſome
who think that the conſent of the People is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
required in the making of Laws, becauſe that
Princes have all their power flowing to them from
the people, which if they do abuſe (as they are to
be eſteemed to abuſe it, if they ſhall extend it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or longer than it ſhall pleaſe the people) the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:154344:142"/>
people by their own right may again re-aſſume that
power which before they had granted to them. This
is a moſt erronious and a dangerous poſition, and
which all thoſe who are not enemies to mankind and
the publick peace ought deſervedly to abhominate;
All their reaſon relyeth on a double foundation, but
both of them very weak, and abhorring to ſober
ſence; The firſt is, that Princes do owe unto the
people for all their power; the other, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is who granteth power to another, it lyeth
in his power to revoke that power when he pleaſeth.
O moſt egregious Sophiſtry! if this were ſo, Were
<hi>Samuel</hi> more to be condemned for his Oratory, who
the more to affright the people being weary of their
<hi>Theocracy,</hi> or Government immediately from God,
and to deterre them from their perverſe affectation
of innovation, had enough to do to lay before their
eyes the vaſt extent of the power of Kings; Or
were the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> more to be condemned
for their folly, who ignorant of their own right
would ſuffer themſelves to be circumvented and
baffled by ſo groſs a pretence, and return nothing
back unto the Prophet, no not ſo much as a word?
Were they all ſo dumb, and ſtupid, and void of
reſolution as well as underſtanding, that not one in
ſo great a multitude could be found, as had either
ſo much acuteneſs or confidence, as readily to make
anſwer to theſe objections of <hi>Samuel,</hi> it being
ſo eaſy for them to give ſuch a ſudden check unto
them? <hi>Tell Boys theſe tales who have the leiſure
to hear them, and not the wit to underſtand them;
We, if (our King ſhall thus begin to domineer)
will uſe our own privileges, and preſently take away
that right from him which we have given to him.</hi> In
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:154344:142"/>
how few words had they done the whole work, and
ſtopped for ever the mouth of the Prophet, if theſe
fictions of new Magiſtrates had been ſo much belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in former ages, as they now are confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuggeſted to new Diſciples, and willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained

in Name, and Bulk, than in Deed, and Power, ſo
that it is not to be doubted (if a true Calculation
be made) but that the Domination of a Family in
the proceſſe of Time, did by degrees, and by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived
inlargement, grow up into a Kingly
Name, and Power; And the Original of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

from this Head. And thus far there is nothing
more plain, nothing more ſure, than that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring

at all, neither indeed could have.</p>
            <p>XVII. From theſe things (as I conceive) we
ſafely may conclude (to note that by the way which
is worthy your obſervation) That the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by which the firſt-born of the whole

<hi>Form</hi> of Nature, when once we have departed
(the impotent and unruly luſt of Domination at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
forbidden wayes to aſcend to the height
of Soveraignty) all things are thereby laid open to
Tyranny, and popular Indeavours; For they who
arrive to Soveraignty otherwiſe than by a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ſucceſſion, muſt neceſſarily be promoted to
it by one of theſe three ways, either by <hi>open
Force,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength of Arms,</hi> or by <hi>Craft and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi>
or thirdly by a <hi>free Election;</hi> Thoſe who by
force of Arms have obtained the Soveraign Power,
whether it were by meer Uſurpation, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretence of Right, or by War made upon their
Enemies, who unjuſtly have provoked them (for
both wayes it comes to paſſe) it is certain do
owe no more their Authority to their Subjects,
than thoſe who ſucceed in their Kingdoms by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Right, nay much leſs, For the one do
govern over their willing Subjects, and uſed to the
yoak, and the other over an unwilling people, and if
they were equal to him in ſtrength, ready to make

thoſe Men, who by Tyranny and Deceit, do
exerciſe a Tyrannical Power, it cannot be denyed,
but that the people have a great intereſt. For thoſe

and being choſen, he exerciſeth a kind of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
within the Subburbs and Precincts of that
place, which it were not lawful for him to exerciſe,
unleſs he had been ſo elected. In the ſame manner
amongſt the Fellows of Colleges, as often as the
Preſidentſhip is vacant, they have the Right to chuſe
a new Preſident, to whom being ſo choſen,
by vertue of the ſaid Election, the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of that College doth pertain; In both
places, the right of perſons electing, doth conſiſt
wholy in the deſignation of the perſon to be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who is to exerciſe the power due unto his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
not as derived from the perſons electing, but
as granted to him upon another account; For the
chief Magiſtrate of a City, oweth not that power
which he exerciſeth in the City, to thoſe fellow
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:154344:146"/>
Citizens of his who made choice of him for that
year to ſit at the Helm of Government, but to the
<hi>Royal Charter,</hi> which according to the favour of it
hath indulged to the City with ſuch a privilege; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the Maſter of College receive the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which he obtaineth in it from the Fellows,
by whoſe ſuffrages he is elected, but from the
Founder, &amp; from his Statutes, who hath given that
Authority to him. In a word, where the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Prince is received from the people, either
by Laws, or Cuſtoms, there the people indeed
do deſign, and nominate the perſon of him who
Governeth, but God alone doth confer upon
him the Authority of Governing.</p>
            <p>XXI. But let us grant to the Flatterers of the
people, this their Suppoſition, a little to gratulate
their Importunity, it will notwithſtanding nothing
prevayl, unleſſe we ſhall grant this alſo, which
they had rather take, than ſolidly prove, That
whoſoever conferreth a Power on any one, it is
lawful for him, as often as he thinks fit, to take
from him that power which he hath given him,
and to reſume it into his own hands; And this is
that which muſt never be granted; for all Reaſon,
and Laws, and Courts of Judicature, are directly
and Loudly againſt it; They declare That all lawful
Contracts are not to be broken, And that a <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
abſolutely made,<note place="margin">Populus in cum omne ſuum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium &amp; poteſtarem tranſtulit <hi>Ulpian.</hi> F. de constit princip.</note> and without any condition,
cannot be revoked, neither in the whole, nor in
part, for the right which before the election was
fully in the perſons electing, the election being
made, doth preſently and in that very deed paſſe
into the perſon elected; and many other things,
to the ſame purpoſe, are over the whole world the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154344:147"/>
moſt received Dictates of nature, and of reaſon,
and approved and confirmed by the conſent of all
Nations, as by the uſe of daily obſervation may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
appear. The ſeven Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>
have a full power to elect an Emperour, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
him from the Empire being elected, they
have no power; The Commonalty of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Boroughs of <hi>England,</hi> that is all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
and Free-holders (as we ſpeak it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the degree of the Nobility of the Land, have
a right by common Suffrages to elect <hi>Knights, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,</hi>
and in their name to ſend them to the high
Court of Parliament, as their Repeſentatives, and
to intruſt them with a power in their ſteed, and
in their behalf to debate of the publick affairs of
the Kingdom; but to abrogate the power which is
once committed to them being elected, although
peradventure they anſwer not the expectation of
thoſe who did elect them, they have no right at all.
The ſame account is to be given of thoſe men in
whoſe power there is a right of electing a Mayor of
a City, or a Preſident of a College, or the head of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other civil Corporation, who, the election being
ended, have no more to do at all, the right &amp; antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Governing being tranſlated into the perſons
elected, whoſe power they are afterwards bound
to obey, and to accquieſce in the election which
they have made, and if the perſon elected
ſhall deport himſelf unworthy of his place, they
are not to impute it to any but themſelves.</p>
            <p>XXII. Theſe things I confeſſe might longer be
inſiſted on, and indeed it would be worth the labour
to proceed further in the proof thereof, and to
pluck up out of the minds of men all the ſtrings of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:154344:147"/>
ſo dangerous a root, and ſo much tending unto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
did not the reguard of the time, and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
call me back from whence I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed;
And peradventure there is no great
need of any longer diſcourſe on this ſubject,
ſeeing out of the things already ſpoken, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is manifeſt enough, how raſhly, and
how dangerouſly alſo, this ſo vaſt a power
is attributed to the people; Nevertheleſs there be
other conſiderable reaſons to be alleged, which
vehemently may perſwade us, that the peoples
conſent and approbation is to be had in the
making of Laws. Firſt, becauſe the Law ought to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
be as a <hi>mind void of any extravagancy of deſire:</hi> but
the Laws of Princes raſhly ſent forth to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Subjects,<note place="margin">Ariſtot. 3. Polit.</note> in the favour and on the behalf of
Courtiers and Flatterers, are oftentimes corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the depraved deſires of impotent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Secondly, becauſe thoſe Laws which are not
allowed when propounded to the Subjects, to ſpeak <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
morally, are preſumed to be either unjuſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or too burdenſome to the Subjects, or at
leaſt unprofitable to the publick; And therefore it
is expedient that they ſhould not be enacted, it
being very incommodious to the Common-wealth,
that Laws ſhould be multiplyed without a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.
Thirdly, becauſe it is manifeſt, that Laws <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
rightly conſtituted, may be ſo abrogated by a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Cuſtome,</hi> that they ceaſe any longer to oblige,
which Cuſtome is nothing elſe, than a conjoyned
conſent of the people, neglecting to obſerve that
Law as being unprofitable, together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Prince not exacting an obſervation of
it; Therefore it being in the ſame power to <hi>deſtroy,</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:154344:148"/>
as it is to <hi>make,</hi> the force of the Laws do ſeem not
a little to depend on the approbation, and conſent
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the people. Fourthly and cheifly, becauſe the
conſent of the people in the making of Laws, and
their concurrence with the power of the Prince,
doth ſo much conduce both to the publick peace of
the whole Kingdome, and the ſafety and ſecurity
of the people, that there can be nothing more;
For moſt likely it is, that all Subjects, will not
grievouſly, but readily and cheerfully obey, both
thoſe Kings who deſire their conſent, and thoſe
Laws to which they themſelves ſhall give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
Neither is it to be feared, that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and Legiſlative power of the King, ſhall
by this means ſuffer any diminution, which is the
only argument that the adverſe party do object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it: for that theſe two, I ſay, the <hi>conſent of
the people,</hi> and the <hi>ſupreme power of the Prince</hi> in
making Laws, may friendly, and at once conſiſt
together, (beſides that there ſeems to be no repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
in the things themſelves) may appear by
this, that our Kings of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe ſupreme
power the Inhabitants of this Kingdom before
theſe late unhappy times, have moſt fully always,
and moſt freely acknowledged, did notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
never ſo exerciſe their Legiſlative power,
as to impoſe any Laws on their Subjects without
their own conſent.</p>
            <p>XXIII. We conceive it therefore to be granted,
that at the leaſt ſome conſent of the people is to be
required in the making of thoſe Laws which in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
may oblige the Subjects.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> But it may be here
doubted,<note place="margin">Ariſtot. 1. Polit 6.</note> and that not unjuſtly, (I ſhall therefore
make this the third Doubt or Demand) how great,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:154344:148"/>
and how much of the conſent of the people may be
required to this, that the <hi>placit</hi> of the Prince may
have the vigour of a Law? I anſwer, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the people of which we now treat,
two things are to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>time</hi> and
<hi>manner</hi> of conſenting; And both theſe do fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
under a twofold conſideration; For either
the Law is conſented to, as to the time, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the promulgation of it, or after; or as to the
manner, that is, with an expreſſe conſent, or <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages,</hi>
or with a tacit conſent, or <hi>cuſtomes.</hi> From
the complexion of theſe there do proceed four ſorts
or degrees of popular conſent.</p>
            <p>XXIV. The firſt and the loweſt, and leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of all, is the tacit or ſilent conſent before the
publication or asking of the Law, which is, when a
people have ſo put themſelves, and all that they
have, in the power of the Conquerour, or by a long
cuſtome of obedience, have ſo entirely ſubmitted
themſelves to the will of the Prince, that whatſoever
he determineth, they do yield unto it; And this may
come to paſſe both ways, for by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that power of the Prince is juſt, which is either
obtained by a juſt War, or confirmed by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſucceſſion as by a right of praeſcription; And this
<hi>degree</hi> indeed, although not very profitable to the
people, if the Prince be pleaſed to turn his power
into tyranny, yet it will ſo far ſuffice, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot complain of any injury done unto them,
if it ſhould ſo fall out that the Prince ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
any thing too ſeverely againſt them, which
peradventure is not unjuſt, but ſuch a thing as they
would not willingly have to be done. As amongſt us
many of the Presbyterians do importunatly (as
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:154344:149"/>
their Cuſtom is) and unjuſtly complain that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Parochial Paſtors is unlawfully taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the People, when thoſe who ought to
be choſen to that Office by the Pariſhoners, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by ſome private perſon, or by ſome College
under the name of a Patron without their Conſent;
not dreaming all the while, that the right of Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if the People heretofore had any, (which
is very uncertain, and if denyed can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
for ſome certain Cauſe from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but by the long preſcription of Time now
unknown, was long agoe conveyed unto thoſe whom
they call the Patrons of Benefices, and ſo in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
made by the Patrons, the Conſent of the
People is virtually involved and contained; which
anſwer, if it be of no force amongſt men that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
in their own opinions, yet of this at leaſt
they are to be advertiſed, which may be enough to
ſatisfie the moſt importunate Adverſary, which is,
that the Rights of <hi>Patronſhips,</hi> and the Advowzons
or Advocations of Churches were long agoe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Authority of Parliament, that is, by the
common and full Conſent of the whole People.
And therefore what is done in this Caſe by a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Patron, the People have already conſented that
it is lawful for him to do it.</p>
            <p>XXV. The ſecond <hi>Degree</hi> is the ſilent Conſent
of the People to ſuch a Law after the promulgation
of it, that is, when the People do not contradict
the Law, made and publiſhed by the King, but
rather do approve it by their Deeds, by conforming
themſelves to the will of the Prince, and by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that which is commanded by the Law; for if he
who but holds his peace doth ſeem to conſent,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:154344:149"/>
much more is he preſumed to conſent,<note place="margin">Leges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituuntur cum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgantur firmantur cum mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probantur <hi>Diſtinct. 4. Sect.</hi> in iſtis.</note> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
an actual obedience. Of this degree of
Conſent thus ſpeaketh <hi>Julian</hi> again in the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
cited. <hi>Quid intereſt ſuffragio Populus volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
ſuam declaret, an rebus et facto? What differ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence
is it if the People do declare their Conſent by
ſuffrages, or by deeds and Acts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXVI. The third <hi>Degree</hi> is the expreſſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the People, to a Law propounded to them
by the Prince, and they conſent unto it being asked,
that is, when a Prince having prepared at home
the matter of the Law by the Counſel of wiſe men,
and though not perfectly drawn it up, yet he hath
run it over, and put it into ſome Form, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to his Subjects to be further examined,
that nothing may openly be contained in it that is
either inconvenient, or abſurd, requiring withall
that they, or a great part of them, if they find it
to be advantagious to the Common-wealth, would
confim it with their Suffrages, that ſo by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
it may paſs into a Law, and this, in ſome
manner, was heretofore the Cuſtom of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
their Common-wealth yet ſtanding, And
from this <hi>asking,</hi> the Rogation of their Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
its original, A word moſt frequent amongſt
the beſt of the Writers of the Roman affairs.</p>
            <p>XXVII. The laſt, and higheſt <hi>Degree,</hi> which
is the greateſt and indeed the true Liberty of the
People, by which we <hi>Brittans</hi> have ſo long been
happy even unto envy under excellent Kings, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
had we not out of our ſtupid Ingratitude made our
ſelves unworthy of ſo great a bleſſing, we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſtill moſt happy, is the expreſſe Conſent of
the People before the enacting of the Law, when the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:154344:150"/>
preſcribed Form thereof (a juſt and deliberate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
being firſt had of the words, and the matter
of it, and approved by the Houſe of Peers, the
Suffrages of the Houſe of Commons conjoined
with them) is at laſt exhibited to the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
to whom alone the chief Power of making
Laws doth belong, that being by him confirmed
if it ſeem good unto him, it may have the Power
and Vertue of a Law, or otherwiſe it may be made
void, and be eſteemed no Law; which manner of
enacting of Laws being moſt prudently deviſed by
our Forefathers, and brought even unto our times by
ſo long a <hi>Series</hi> of Kings and years, hath been found
by the Uſe and Experience of all Ages paſt, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the Common-wealth, that if unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Counſels had not been taken (to ſpeak no more
of it) for the removing of the old <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi>
from their right Places, our Churches, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſityes,
The King, The People, The Common-wealth,
and every private Family had by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ng
of God yet flouriſhed, which now by his moſt
juſt Judgment do goe to wrack, and every day do
ſuffer more and more. And I do believe that
a better way cannot eaſily be thought upon by the
wit of man, to moderate on the one ſide the Power
of Kings, and to check, and to reſtrain on the other
ſide the Licence of the People.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. The fourth Doubt followeth of the
Laws of leſſe Commonalties, for examples ſake of
Cities, Univerſities, Colleges, and Schools, which
beſides the Laws common to all the Subjects of
the Kingdom, do rejoice in their own private Laws,
Rights and Statutes. The Queſtion is, to what
<hi>Perſons</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of making their Laws doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:154344:150"/>
and being made, <hi>whom</hi> and to <hi>what</hi> they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige?
The anſwer is not difflcult, I ſay therefore
in the firſt place, theſe Societies, Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and Colleges being all Members of the great
Body of the Kingdom, and are contained in it as
the inferiour <hi>orbes</hi> of the Heavens are contained in
the Superiour, it is not lawfull for any College or
Society, or for the Governours or Overſers of them,
to make <hi>private</hi> Laws for their own uſe, which may
be contrary or any ways prejudicial to the publick
Laws of the whole Kingdom; I ſay in the ſecond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
place, that ſeeing by the grant of Princes, and their
ſpecial grace, and indulgence, theſe ſocieties are
incorporated, &amp; enjoy no other Rights, Privileges, or
prerogatives beſides thoſe which it is manifeſt have
been granted to them by a long praeſcription of
time, or by the Charters &amp; Letters Patents of the
King, it is to be concluded, that all the <hi>Legiſlative
power</hi> which is derived from them, is a derived, &amp;
not a <hi>primitive</hi> power, &amp; is at laſt to be reſolved into
the ſupreme power of the King as the true original
of it, and therefore the ſaid Societies and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of them cannot according to their own will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſtitute or actually exerciſe any power in
the making of Laws, unleſſe according to the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
and the <hi>meaſure</hi> of that power vouchſafed by
the indulgence of the Prince. I ſay in the third
place, that Laws made by private Colleges and
corporated Societies, according to the tenor of the
power granted them by the King, do oblige all the
Members of the ſaid Societies, and of all thoſe that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
are under their juriſdiction or Government, and
none but thoſe, <hi>directly of it ſelf,</hi> and by its <hi>own
force,</hi> but by the Virtue of the <hi>Kings ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:154344:151"/>
on whoſe authority they rely, and from which
they receive all their force, they do in ſome ſenſe,
and indirectly oblige all and every Subject of the
whole Kingdome; but there is not the one and ſame
<hi>account,</hi> nor degree of theſe two obligations; For
theſe Laws oblige thoſe of their own Society to the
diligent obſervation of them, but the others unto
this, that they do no ways violate, or diminiſh them,
or hinder the obſervation of them.</p>
            <p>XXIX. The fifth Doubt is of Eccleſiaſtical Laws
in the <hi>Species</hi> of them; And that new Laws may
be made concerning <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> things
and <hi>perſons,</hi> and of all Circumſtances of outward
external worſhip belonging to Order, Honeſty,
and Edification, beſides thoſe delivered by Chriſt
and his Apoſtles in the word of God, is a thing ſo
manifeſt, and conſentanious to Reaſon, that he will
hardly clear himſelf from the ſuſpition of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
and obſtinate Spirit, who being dry, and ſober
will deny it; but ſince the time that the Divines have
divided themſelves into ſeveral parties, it cannot
eaſily be agreed upon amongſt them to underſtand
unto whom it doth belong to make Eccleſiaſtical
Laws. The Papiſts who would have the Clergy
to be exempted from all juriſdiction of the Civil
Magiſtrate (of which controverſy we cannot here
diſpute) do affirm that <hi>Biſhops</hi> only, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them the chief <hi>Biſhop</hi> eſpecially, whom
they call the <hi>Biſhop Oecumenical,</hi> hath the right and
power to make Laws, which may not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Conſciences of the Clergy, but of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
alſo, and that without any conſent, or licence
of the <hi>politick Magiſtrate.</hi> There are ſome who
(the perſon only, but not the opinion being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged)
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:154344:151"/>
do embrace this <hi>Tenet,</hi> as alſo many others
of the Papiſts, who notwithſtanding do profeſſe
themſelves moſt bitter enemies unto Popery, but
in the mean time the <hi>Diſciplinary Reformers</hi> our
new <hi>Davuſſes</hi> do diſturb all things, and having taken
away all Power, Authority, and Eccleſiaſtical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
from the King, they do challenge it only to
themſelves, and to their own <hi>Claſſes</hi> and <hi>Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
The <hi>Eraſtians</hi> on the other ſide, and our new
Reformers no leſſe than they, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Reformation, having altogether diſinveſted
the Clergy of all Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, do who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attribute the univerſal right of the external Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church to the Civil Magiſtrate;
And moreover as for theſe our own <hi>Diſciplinarians</hi>
at home, Good God! what Monſters of names and
opinions, as full of <hi>Deformity</hi> as of <hi>Difformity</hi> have
theſe laſt ſeven years fruitful of prodiges brought
forth, and nurſed under the pretence of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>XXX. I have neither the leiſure nor reſolution
(unleſs I ſhould appear too troubleſom to you) to
grapple at this time with both theſe Adverſaries;
But in theſe (as in many other Debates) that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſeemeth to be the truer, and is truly the ſafer,
which is lodged in the middle betwixt the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
and I am confident you will be ſo much
the more willing to imbrace it, by how much it is
more agreeable to the Doctrine of the Engliſh
Church, as alſo to the Laws of the Kingdom, which
is, That the Right of making Eccleſiaſtical Laws is
in the Power of Biſhops, Elders and other Perſons
duely elected by the Clergy of the whole Kingdom;
But ſo nevertheleſs that the Exerciſe of the ſame

as much as conduceth to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

have already been handled by us.
In this place we are to ſpeak of ſuch as may
be reduced to the <hi>Formal kind of Cauſes,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
peradventure not ſo properly, (if examined
according to the acurate and exact Method) yet in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:154344:153"/>
my Judgment not altogether incongruous to our
Diſcourſe on this preſent Subject. They may all of
them be reduced to two Heads, The one of the
<hi>publication of Lawes,</hi> and the other of the <hi>penalty</hi>
adjoined to them to be inflicted on Delinquents.
Both of which as they are expreſsly contained in the
Text above cited, (The Publication of the Law in
the ſeventh verſe, and the penalty of it in the eighth
verſe) ſo the uſe of them is very neceſſary, both by
the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Law it ſelf, and to obtain the
<hi>Effect</hi> of the Law; For ſeeing the Law by its own
Nature, and as it is a rule of things to be done,
ought to have a double Power, <hi>viz.</hi> A Power of
<hi>Directing,</hi> by ſhewing unto the Subjects what is to
be done, and what is not to be done, and a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of obliging, by ſuggeſting into their minds a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of obeying; The Law could not duely, and
effectually exerciſe this twofold Power, unleſs the
Subject were informed what is the will of the Prince,
which is done by <hi>publication,</hi> and underſtood withall
by the penalty annexed to it, how much it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
him to perform it.</p>
            <p>II. Concerning the Publication of the Law; the
firſt Doubt is, Whether this publication be meerly
on the Account of, and as it were intrinſecal to the
Law? That is to enquire, Whether, that as the
Law hath the Power of <hi>directing</hi> and <hi>obliging,</hi>
the promulgation of it be ſo neceſſary that it wanteth
of that Power unleſs it be promulgated; Now in all
this Diſcourſe you are to underſtand, that I take not
this word <hi>Promulgation</hi> as it is uſed in <hi>Cicero</hi> &amp; other
Roman writers, but according to the received manner
of ſpeaking amongſt the Schoolmen &amp; the Canoniſts
of the latter Ages; for in that <hi>Promulgation</hi> of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:154344:153"/>
Antients, the Law not yet eſtabliſhed, or fully
made, was propounded to the people publickly on
three Market days of their approbation of it; But
the Publication of which we now ſpeak, is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
of a Law already made, that the People
may take notice of it. I therefore ſhall briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Doubt propoſed, and ſay, That this
Publication is ſo neceſſary and ſo intrinſecal to the
Law, that in ſome manner it may be called the <hi>Form</hi>
of it, and thereupon amongſt many Authors it is a
part of the Definition of it; and indeed it is
abſolutely neceſſary to this, that the Law may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
the Office of a Law, which is to direct, and
to oblige the Subjects, whom it cannot direct, much
leſs oblige, although made by never ſo juſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Authority, unleſs it be known to them, and
it cannot be known unleſs it be publiſhed; For that
which properly induceth the obligation, is the <hi>Will</hi>
and <hi>Authority</hi> of the Prince or Governor, not as a
ſingle, but as a publick Perſon, and the Head of
the Commonalty; But unleſs by ſome publick
means he ſhall cauſe his Will to be propounded, and
made known unto the People, it cannot by any Law
be manifeſt (at leaſt according to the interpretation
of the Law) that it is his Will, and proceedeth from
his Authority as he ſuſtaineth a publick Perſon;<note place="margin">Diſt. 4. Sect. In iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And from hence is that of the Canon Law, <hi>Leges

Law unto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Mount of <hi>Sinai,</hi> or

and Cities in the whole world, who as
ſoon as their Laws were made, did in the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places expoſe them to the obſervation of the
people engraven in Tables of Braſs or Wood; the

wrote their Laws. Of the ſame nature
were the twelve Tables of the Romans, and others
of other Nations, concerning which let thoſe men
who have the leiſure to be curious of ſuch antiquities
conſult with the <hi>Philologers,</hi> and the writers of
Dictionaries of both languages; we muſt proceed
to other things.</p>
            <p>III. The neceſſity of the publication of Laws
being thus granted and determined, there ariſeth a
ſecond Doubt, What this promulgation of the Law
ought to be, that it may paſs for lawfull, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
an obligation? In anſwer to which I ſay in
the firſt place, that the manner, and the reaſon of
publiſhing a Law, as to the particular <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi>
may be varyed according to the Cuſtoms
of diverſe Nations; But all do agree in this, and by
common uſe it is required, that the Law-giver take
ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to have his <hi>will</hi> ſo propounded, and manifeſted
to his Subjects by ſome external ſign, that it may
publickly be known unto them all, ſo that none of
thoſe who are bound to obſerve the Law maybe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that the ſaid Law is extant, and this is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:154344:154"/>
required, becauſe the power of directing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal
and eſſential to the Law, &amp; Subjects cannot
direct their actions according to the will of their
Prince, unleſſe they know what his will is, &amp; how can
they know it unleſſe by proclamation, or by writing,
or inſculpture, or ſome other outward ſign it be
ſufficiently expoſed, and manifeſted to them?</p>
            <p>IV. I ſay in the ſecond place, To the publication
of a Law to oblige the Subjects, it is not only requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Lawgiver doth publickly ſignifie his will
unto them, but he is to proceed further, that is,
to have it done in a ſolemn manner, or at leaſt that
it be ſo done (which is even as much as a ſolemn
Right) that it may be ſufficiently teſtified and
made known unto his Subjects, that the Law-giver
intended, that this <hi>will</hi> of his may have the power
of a Law, and that it may oblige them; the reaſon
is, becauſe, not every will of the Superiour,
although known unto the Subject, doth preſently,
and <hi>in ipſo facto</hi> oblige him, unleſs withall it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that the Superiour had an intention that it
ſhould oblige him; For every Superiour endued
with a Legiſlative power, and ſuſtaining a double
perſon, the one <hi>private,</hi> as a <hi>ſingle man,</hi> the other
<hi>publick,</hi> as a <hi>Lawful Superiour,</hi> doth come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a double conſideration. In the midſt of theſe
late tumults, the unhappy caprichiouſneſs of ſome
wits did put me to this new diſtinction, concerning
the <hi>perſonal,</hi> and <hi>political Capacity</hi> of a King. The
Diſtinction in my judgment is ſomething more
proper to our preſent buſineſs, than to the Subject
then in hand; It is this, the will of a Prince, (if a
Prince: be conſidered as in his perſonal capacity)
that is as he is a ſingle, and as it were a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:154344:155"/>
carries not with him the reſpect of a Law, and
obligeth not his Subjects to direct their Actions
according to it; Therefore to oblige the Subjects,
It is not enough for a Prince any way to ſignify
unto them, that he will have <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> done,
unleſſe upon ſome other account it be manifeſt,
that it is his will to have it ſo done, as he is in his
<hi>Political Capacity,</hi> that is, as he is a Prince, and
the Head of the Commonalty, and as he ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a publick perſon with a <hi>Legiſlative Power,</hi>
which ſeeing it cannot be made manifeſt enough
by the bare ſignification of his Will, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that by ſome more publick, and ſolemn Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
it ſhould be atteſted unto thoſe whom it
concerns to have the knowledge of it, leſt any
man, for the excuſe of his Diſobedience, might
pretend that rotten, and that vulgar one, <hi>I had
not thought of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. I ſay in the third place, In large Empires
which contain many Provinces, it is requiſite that
the publication of a new Law be made in every
Province of the Empire. Some there are who
think this to be ſimply neceſſary, and to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the nature of the Law, which doth not
oblige, unleſſe it be received of the people; And
therefore if be only publiſhed in a Princes Court,
or in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the whole Kingdom, or
ſome chief Cities thereof, the promulgation of it is
no way ſufficient to oblige thoſe who do live in
the more remote places, and provinces; But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this be not abſolutely neceſſarily (neither
doth the nature of the Law ſeem to require it, and
the common opinion of the Doctors, as well as the
common practice of moſt Nations are of another
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:154344:155"/>
Judgment, yet it is profitable that it ſhould be done,
that ſo the Law, to which all men are bound, as
much as may be, may come to the knowledge of
all men; which by how much the more eaſily it
may be done in our times, than in Ages heretofore,
before the Art of printing was found out, by ſo
much the more inexcuſable is the neglect; But to
make no digreſſion, The manner of <hi>publiſhing our
Laws</hi> which is received amongſt us, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeem to be the moſt ſufficient, but the moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
and commodious of all others, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Laws ſigned and paſſed by the King, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Repreſentatives of the whole Kingdom
in the Houſes of Parliament, the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſſolved, be committed to the preſſe, and
printed by the Kings Printer, and in a known Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
that no man may doubt, but that the ſaid
Laws are lawfully made, and ſufficiently publiſhed.</p>
            <p>VI. The third Doubt, It being ſuppoſed, that
the Law is ſufficiently publiſhed; When doth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
begin to oblige the Subjects, preſently after the
publication of it, or ſome time afterwards? I
anſwer in the firſt place, that it is beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
that thoſe Laws, in which a certain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
time of obligation is defined, As ſoon as that
time is arrived, the ſaid Laws begin preſently to
oblige, and the obligation of them is perpetual,
unleſs there be a time for the obligation of them,
which in the ſame Laws is expreſſed, or they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to be abrogated by a new Law, or by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
cuſtome. And hence it is, that according to
the common conſent of the Civil Lawyers, the
Laws of the Emperour being newly made, do not
oblige the Subjects of the ſaid Empire, unleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:154344:156"/>
the ſpace of two months after the promulgation
of them, becauſe that this time <hi>by ſome Authority
in the Novels,</hi> as in all other of their Laws is to be
obſerved, is univerſaly prefixed &amp; defined, &amp; for this
intent, that it is preſumed, that in the ſpace of two
months the knowledge of the ſaid Law may eaſily
be brought unto all the Subjects. I ſay in the ſecond
place, That in the Kingdoms, and Common-wealths,
where nothing of any certainty is either defined by
Law, or received by cuſtome, concerning the
time in which Laws new made do begin to oblige,
the ſaid Laws having no certain time of obligation
affixed to them, do preſently as ſoon as ever they
are publiſhed, according to the manner of the
Country, oblige all thoſe Subjects to whoſe notice
they are arrived, or where it was not in the fault of
the Lawmaker, but that they might have come to
the knowledge of them. For ſeeing the obligation
of the Law dependeth on the will of the Law-giver,
and not on the notice of the Subject, it
followeth, that the obligation of the Law is of
force, when the Law-giver hath ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
his will to his Subjects by ſome outward
ſign, whether it were made known to all his
Subjects, or whether it ſo fell out that ſome
of them peradventure were ignorant of it; For
grant but the Law, and the obligation is granted,
which hath its dependency on the Law, as it is a
Law, and neceſſarily followeth it, as every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Effect doth follow its proper Cauſe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
we have often mentioned. Therefore there
being nothing wanting to a Law that is required to
the compleating of its eſſence, after that it is made,
and ſufficiently publiſhed, it altogether followeth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:154344:156"/>
that a Law ſo made and publiſhed, ought preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to inferre an obligation; neither is it any wayes
inconvenient, that an obligation be made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ours by the <hi>will</hi> only &amp; <hi>Act</hi> of another, we not
knowing it, if the ſaid obligation doth carry with
it the nature &amp; conſtruction of a <hi>moral Debt,</hi> as the
Schoolmen ſpeak it; Although from obligations and
debts w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> ariſe from contracts, the caſe is otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>VII. The <hi>fourth</hi> Doubt; How the Law doth
reach unto thoſe, who though after a ſufficient
publication of it, and the elapſe of the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
by the Law, have not yet <hi>actually</hi> any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it? Which is to demand, whether he to
whom the Law is not actually known, be ſo guilty
of the fault, that he tranſgreſſeth, if he doth any
thing againſt it, and thereupon deſerveth that
puniſhment which that Law inflicteth on the
tranſgreſſors of it? The reaſon of this <hi>Doubt</hi> is,
on the one ſide, becauſe that obligation is vain,
or rather none at all, which obligeth neither to the
<hi>fault,</hi> nor to the <hi>puniſhment;</hi> And on the other ſide,
both becauſe it is abſurd to be bound to that
which is impoſſible; but to obſerve a Law which
we know not, is certainly impoſſible; as alſo,
becauſe from the two Offices of the Law above
ſpecified, it is neceſſary that the power of <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
as firſt by Nature, muſt go before the
other power of <hi>obliging,</hi> ſo that the Law cannot
oblige any, but whom it directeth, and it cannot
direct any, but thoſe to whom it is known. This
being laid down in the firſt place, which admits of
no <hi>ſcruple, viz.</hi> that the Subject to whom the Law
is known, is obliged both to the <hi>fault,</hi> and to the
<hi>puniſhment;</hi> As for thoſe that know not the Law,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:154344:157"/>
I anſwer to the propounded <hi>doubt,</hi> and ſay in the
firſt place, that he who by his groſſe negligence is
ignorant of the Law, when it proceeds from his
own <hi>fault</hi> that he is ignorant of it, is no leſſe, or
at leaſt not much leſſe guilty of the <hi>fault,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
<hi>puniſhment</hi> as well as he who doth know
the Law, and doth it not. For the Ignorance of
that thing which every man ought to know, and
may know, doth excuſe no man; And in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the Law, there is no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a <hi>wilful Ignorance,</hi> and a <hi>fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. I ſay in the ſecond place, That he who is
therefore ignorant of the Law, becauſe he was a
little more careleſſe, or negligent, than in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of that moment he ought to be, although
the <hi>fault</hi> be never ſo <hi>light,</hi> as the <hi>Civilians</hi> term it,
yet becauſe it is manifeſt, it was done by a <hi>fault,</hi>
and by his <hi>own Fault,</hi> he is not altogether free
from the obligation of the Law. My Reaſon is,
becauſe that Ignorance was <hi>vincible,</hi> as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſpeak, that is, which could be overcome,
for if the Subject had been ſo diligent as he ought
to have been, and as the dignity of the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and as wiſe men uſe to be in their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of greater weight, he could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
it is preſumed, of the promulgation of the
Law; Now his Ignorance of that Law, according
to which every man is bound to direct his Actions
being in him an ignorance that might have been
helped, this Ignorance cannot be but culpable, and
if culpable, in whatoever degree it be, it cannot
but accordingly be inexcuſable. It may be argued;
But by how much the lighter the fault is, the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:154344:157"/>
in both Courts, is ſo much the more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and amongſt the equal Arbitrators of things,
doth deſerve a more eaſy pardon. It is to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that he was before obliged by the Law,
although he was ignorant of it; And it is manifeſt
by this, becauſe as ſoon as ever, by the Teſtimony
of ſome man of Reputation, he underſtood that
the Law was publiſhed, he immediately in his
own Conſcience judged himſelf to be obliged by
that Law, now there could ariſe no obligation from
a new report, or by the Teſtimony of this man,
neither is there any power of obligation either in
himſelf, or in his Teſtimony, therfore without doubt
he was obliged before by that Law, although he
had neither <hi>notice</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> nor any <hi>Conſcience</hi>
of the <hi>Obligation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IX. I ſay in the third place; He who in <hi>earneſt</hi>
and <hi>invincibly,</hi> either by accident or any other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,
and by no neglect of his own, is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the promulgation of a Law, as if any man
ſhould be viſited with madneſs, or labour under
ſome long or grievous diſeaſe, or being newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from forein Countries, ſhould never hear
of the publication of ſuch a Law, nor indeed could
hear of it, he is not by that Law obliged either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fault, or any puniſhment of the fault ſo
properly named; Nevertheleſs by the ſame Law
which he is invincibly ignorant of, he may become
ſo far lyable to a <hi>puniſhment</hi> improperly ſo called,
that is to ſome <hi>loſſe</hi> to be ſuſtained. The firſt part
of this poſition is thus proved; No man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a fault, or deſerveth puniſhment who doth
not Sin; but he who keeps not a Law, of which
he is invincibly ignorant, doth not Sin (for if he
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:154344:158"/>
ſhould ſin, he were obliged to that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible)
therefore he cannot deſervedly be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
nor juſtly puniſhed; But that he may be obliged
to ſome dammage to be ſuſtained by that Law (which
is the other part of our aſſertion) ſhall appear to be
moſt clear by this example. Suppoſe there be a Law
prohibiting ſome certain kind of Traſſiquings and
Contracts, by which Law, amongſt other things, it is
decreed that all ſuch contracts, made one month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the promulgation of the ſaid Law, ſhall be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
void, and of no effect; If any man after that
month is run out, being in good earneſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly
ignorant of the promulgation of that Law,
ſhall ſtrike ſuch a bargain, which is by the ſaid Law
forbidden, he will be clear indeed from the fault,
by reaſon of his invincible Ignorance which was
impoſſible to be helped, and conſequently he ought
to be free from the puniſhment, which juſtly is due
to no man, but for the fault; nevertheleſſe he
ſhall not only ſuſtain the Dammage, by reaſon of
the <hi>nullity</hi> of the Contract, which he entred into,
but he is bound alſo to ſuſtain it according to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
both by the force of obedience, which is
due unto the Law; and by his reflection on the
publick profit; The like is to be determined in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Laws of the like nature; For examples
ſake, In thoſe Laws by which perſons are diſabled, &amp;
by which privileges are revoked, In thoſe Laws by
which Uſury is moderated, and in thoſe by which
certain prices of things to be ſold are conſtituted,
and in the like, of which the Canoniſts and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do treat at large. Neither ought this ſeem to
be unjuſt to any man; for although a Dammage be
ſometimes called a Puniſhment, it is only <hi>analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:154344:158"/>
and very <hi>improperly,</hi> for otherwiſe there is a
great difference betwixt a Dammage, and a Penalty
or puniſhment properly ſo called; If an innocent
perſon be puniſhed, a great injury is done unto him;
but often it comes to paſſe, that an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may be dammaged, and yet no great injury done
unto him. And thus much as conduceth to our
preſent purpoſe, may ſuffize to be ſpoken of the
promulgation of the Law.</p>
            <p>X. In the next place we are to ſpeak of the <hi>penal
Law,</hi> in which many things being omitted which
unprofitably are accuſtomed to be diſputed
by many of the Caſuiſts, and which pertain rather
to the external and pleading Courts, as that of the
Canoniſts and Papiſts, than to the internal Court
of Conſcience, we ſhall be contented to give a
view unto you of ſome few, and the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of them, and which moſt neerly we conceive
do conduce to the Government of Conſcience: In
this kind we meet firſt of all with this doubt; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Conſtitution of the puniſhment doth any

It ſeemeth that it doth, not as ſomething
that is <hi>extrinſecally</hi> requiſite to compleat the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of it, ſo that the Law were not a Law, if
the penalty were not annexed to it, but only <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,</hi>
as ſomething neceſſary to this, that the
Law may <hi>effectually</hi> obtain the end which it inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
For the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in the <hi>Precept</hi> of it: I here underſtand <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
as it is largely taken to comprehend a <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
with it, as in the Scriptures are the words

commonly called <hi>Precepts;</hi> And from this <hi>Precept</hi>
alone, both the powers do depend, which we have
ſaid to be in the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the power of directing
the Action, and of obliging the Conſciences of
the Subjects; For the Subject hath a ſufficient
Rule, according to which he ought to direct his
Actions, and to the obſervation whereof, unleſſe
he will be wanting in his duty, he is bound in
Conſcience, as ſoon as he underſtands that his
lawful Superior hath commanded <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> by
Law, whether there be any puniſhment annexed
to that Law, or not; Therefore this neceſſity of
annexing the puniſhment doth not ariſe from the

Dictates of Conſcience. From this double <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi>
it comes to paſſe that the wiſeſt Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
have alwayes judged it neceſſary, and ſaving
to the Common-wealth, to add more force to the
obſervation of the Laws, by the fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that after the example of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:154344:159"/>
who pronounced not the firſt Law which he
gave to man, without the threatning of a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Some good Citizens peradventure
(whoſe number are but few) induced only by the
Conſcience of their Duty, and their Love unto
Virtue, and their Country, would render O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
unto the Laws, although there were no
puniſhment propounded, but the <hi>Turba,</hi> or the
greateſt number, are inforced only by the fear of
puniſhment to the performance of their Duties;
It is manifeſt hereby, that the Conſtitution of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
in the making of Laws, is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>XI. The ſecond <hi>Doubt</hi> is, concerning the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the penal Law, as to the extenſion of it,
whether the penal Law doth oblige only unto the
penalty, or whether it obligeth unto the fault alſo?
Which is to demand, if a Subject may ſo ſatisfie
the Law, and his Duty, if being prepared to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe,
and by undergoing the penalty conſtituted
by the Law, he may be no longer guilty of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency,
although he obſerveth not the command of
the Law; Or whether, for all that, he is not bound in
Conſcience to the performance of that, which is
by the is Law commanded. That more clearly and
diſtinctly we may anſwer to this doubt, it being
a Queſtion of great Moment, and of which in the
Common Lives of Men, there is a moſt frequent uſe;
It will not be amiſſe, the better to unfold it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſome things which are very profitable before
hand to be known. We are to underſtand therfore in
the firſt place, that that <hi>poſitive Humane Law,</hi> ought
only to be called <hi>Penal,</hi> which by the will of the
Legiſlator, doth expreſly determine ſome <hi>temporal</hi>
puniſhment for the <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> of it; And in all
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:154344:160"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:154344:161"/>
this diſcourſe, as often as mention is made of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
you are to underſtand no other, but only a
<hi>Temporal puniſhment.</hi> This word <hi>Temporal puniſhment</hi>
is taken in a twofold Conſideration, either as 'tis
oppoſed to the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or as it is oppoſed to
<hi>Eternal puniſhment,</hi> And for the moſt part in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
diſcourſe they are taken as Members contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
to one another, ſometimes <hi>Spiritual</hi> oppoſed
to <hi>Temporal,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Eternal</hi> unto <hi>Temporal;</hi>
there are therefore three kinds of puniſhments, or,
if you will, you may call them, <hi>Species,</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of puniſhments, or degrees of puniſhments;
For whatſoever comes under the name of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
is firſt, Either a ſpiritual puniſhment, as the
<hi>loſſe</hi> or the <hi>deprivation</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> &amp; of the friendſhip
of God, or of that inward joy, and conſolation,
which ariſeth from the ſence of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Or ſecondly, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Eternal puniſhment, which
conſiſteth partly in the <hi>Eternal Deprivation</hi> of the
beatifical viſion of God and Chriſt, and partly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in the eternal <hi>Torments</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> Or thirdly, it is
a temporal puniſhment, diſtinguiſhed from both
the former, which pertaineth to the ſtate of this
preſent life, and hath relation only to the body,
and external things, neither doth it take away <hi>of
it ſelf</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> either the ſence of the Grace
of God, or the <hi>Hope</hi> of everlaſting life; Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
puniſhments of this nature are the loſſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Baniſhment, Impriſonment, or <hi>Fines</hi> ſet
on the head of any one, courgings, and many of the
like; and laſtly death it ſelf. Thoſe puniſhments
which are the chiefeſt and of moſt frequent uſe
may be reduced to theſe heads, <hi>Death, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Confication of goods,</hi> and <hi>Impriſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:154344:161"/>
XII. In the ſecond place we are to underſtand,
that <hi>puniſhment</hi> as it is oppoſed to the <hi>fault,</hi> is taken
again two wayes; For ſometimes it is taken <hi>largely,</hi>
and <hi>materially,</hi> as it is oppoſed to it in a contrary
oppoſition, that is, as it is another <hi>Species</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the ſame <hi>Genus;</hi> And ſo every <hi>Evil</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth
any man, which is not <hi>malum culpae,</hi> the
<hi>Evil</hi> of the <hi>fault,</hi> is called a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> or <hi>malum
Poene,</hi> the <hi>Evil</hi> of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> although it be not
inflicted on him who indureth it for any <hi>fault</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, but caſually or by injury it may happen
to him; ſo a ſuddain Diſeaſe, mony taken away by
theft, a Wound given by a thief, goods loſt by fire,
or Shipwrack, and all kind of <hi>Hurt</hi> or <hi>Dammage</hi>
which is grievous to indure, is to be numbred
amongſt things penal, and to come under the name
of <hi>puniſhment;</hi> Sometimes the word <hi>puniſhment</hi>
is taken more <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> and as it were <hi>formally,</hi> as it
is oppoſed to the <hi>fault</hi> in a relating oppoſition, that
is, as it is inflicted on a man for a preceding <hi>fault;</hi>
As if a man ſhould be mulcted fourfold for the
goods of another taken away by Theft, or ſhould
be baniſhed for ſedition; And this is the proper,
the former the improper ſignification of the word
<hi>penalty</hi> or <hi>puniſhment</hi> for <hi>puniſhment</hi> is improperly
ſo called, when no <hi>fault</hi> did go before it; From
hence proceeded that moſt known Definition of
<hi>puniſhment,</hi> that it is, <hi>Supplicum quo quis proper
delictum afficitur; It is a puniſhment with which any
man is inflicted for a fault.</hi> Secondly, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
diſputation we intend to debare on both the
ſignifications of the word, as the nature of the
diſcourſe ſhall require; But the laſt is the chiefeſt,
for it is called a <hi>penal Law,</hi> not ſo much in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:154344:162"/>
of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage,</hi> or the <hi>Hurt</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> can come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any man by occaſion of the Law (&amp; that peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
juſtly, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough without any fault of his) as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the puniſhment, w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> by the determination
of the Law is appointed for thoſe who do trangreſs it.</p>
            <p>XIII. In the third place we are to know, That
in penal Laws, ſome are purely penal, and others
mixed, <hi>A Law purely penal</hi> is, when in the <hi>ſimple
ordination of it,</hi> it only appoints the puniſhment,
and neither by commanding, or forbidding doth
expreſſly enjoyn any thing. For examples ſake,
ſuppoſe there be a Law which giveth power to the
Inhabitants of any City or Town, to chooſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year one of the moſt remarkable of the Citizens
to be their Mayo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or Bayliff, this clauſe being added
to the find Law, <hi>The Citizen who is choſen, and
ſhall refuſe the place, ſhall be fineà one hundred
pounds,</hi> This Law is purely penal, becauſe it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
a puniſhment for thoſe who ſhall refuſe to
undertake that office, nevertheleſs it command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no man to undertake it, nor forbiddeth any
man to refuſe it. <hi>A penal Law that is mixed,</hi> is, when
it commandeth any thing to be done, or forbideth
any thing, the penalty being added that is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on the Tranſgreſſors. For Examples ſake, let
us ſuppoſe a Law to be declared in this or the like
Form, <hi>Let no man preſume to tranſport any of the
Merchandize of this Nation into a forain Kingdom,
or to ſell any forain Merchandize in any place of this
Kingdom, unleſs be paeyeth the accuſtomed Tribute, he
who ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> otherwiſe ſhall ſuffer the loſs of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
he vendeth.</hi> This is a penal Law, becauſe it
hath a penalty annexed to it, nevertheleſs it is not
purely <hi>penal,</hi> but <hi>mixed,</hi> for under that <hi>penalty</hi> it
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:154344:162"/>
commandeth the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> to be paid, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the exportation, or the ſelling of Wares, the
Cuſtoms not payed. Some there are who think
that there is a third kind of a <hi>penal Law</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to theſe two, which containeth at once both the
command and the puniſhment, but neither of them
<hi>poſitively</hi> and <hi>ſpecially,</hi> but both of them <hi>disjunctive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>indifferently;</hi> For examples ſalte, let there
be a Law under this Form, <hi>Being choſen by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
of the City, either undergoe the Office of the
Mayor, or chief Magiſtrate, or pay a hundred pound;</hi>
There needs not for this cauſe that any new <hi>Species</hi>
ſhould be added; For the <hi>Species</hi> of things are
not to be multiplyed without neceſſity; And this <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive
Form</hi> of propounding the Law, ought to be
referred to that which is <hi>purely penal,</hi> for in it ſelf it
containeth no abſolute command; if you allege;
Of theſe two things, though neither of them is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>definitely,</hi> yet both of them are commanded
<hi>indefinitely;</hi> I eaſily may reply, to command <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,</hi>
and under a <hi>disjunction</hi> (to ſpeak properly) is
no more to command, than to ſay that the picture of
a man, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a man; This <hi>disjunctive Law</hi> therefore (as I
have ſaid) is purely <hi>penal,</hi> which is manifeſt by the
compared Form of the examples. For if the Law-maker
ſhall put forth the Edict in this manner, <hi>He
who being elected ſhall refuſe the Mayoralty, ſhall
pay one hundred pound,</hi> or in this manner, <hi>being elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either be Mayor, or pay one hundred pounds,</hi> it
is all one; There is, in both, the ſame ſence, the ſame
force of the words, and one &amp; the ſame ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igation.</p>
            <p>XIV. In the fourth place, we are to know, that
between an obligation to the <hi>fault,</hi> and an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>temporal puniſhment,</hi> there is no <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:154344:163"/>
Connexion,</hi> or certainly not ſo neeeſſary
that it may be alſo reciprocal; There is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Conſequence indeed from a <hi>Temporal puniſhment</hi>
properly ſo called, to the <hi>fault;</hi> And this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therefore is of force, <hi>Peter</hi> is to be puniſhed
by the Law, therefore <hi>Peter</hi> hath committ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a fault;
But from a temporal puniſhment, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
ſuppoſe any dammage or the like, the fault
is not neceſſarily inferred; For a man without any
fault of at all his own may be obliged to a loſſe, as
already we have ſaid. Neither is the Conſequence
<hi>reciprocal</hi> from the fault to the temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
For it may ſo come to paſſe, that a man
may be obliged to the fault, and yet not be obliged
to the puniſhment, I mean a temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the account is far otherwiſe of the
<hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal puniſhment.</hi> For examples
ſake, ſuppoſe a man hath committed a fault, as
he hath told a lye, or betrayed the ſecrets of his
friend, or hath privately detracted from the good
name of his Neighbour, for which the Laws of
men do appoint no puniſhment, he therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be puniſhed by man with any temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neither is it neceſſary that God ſhould
temporally afflict him. But that no man may too
boldly flatter himſelf, &amp; aſſume unto himſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a greater liberty of ſinning, becauſe he thinks
himſelf free from temporal puniſhment, he ought
duly to call to mind, that he is nevertheleſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to a far more grievous puniſhment, which
is a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and an <hi>Eternal puniſhment,</hi> Both
which puniſhments are ſo neceſſarily, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
conjoyned with every fault, that the
puniſhment doth alwayes preſuppoſe a fault going
before it (for God puniſheth no man that deſerves
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:154344:163"/>
it not) and at the laſt the deſerved puniſhment
muſt neceſſarily follow the fault, unleſs it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the mercy of God remitting the fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t in
Chriſt by Faith, and by Repentance.</p>
            <p>XV. Theſe things thus premiſed, to anſwer to
the propounded <hi>Doubt,</hi> I will inferre ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions;
And in the firſt place we muſt judge,
How the penal Law doth oblige the Subject in
Conſcience by the mind and Intention of the Law-maker,
If it be manifeſt that there is any certainty
of it that is, if it be certain that the Law-maker
did intend to oblige the Subjects, not only to the
<hi>penalty,</hi> but to the fault alſo, they are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
obliged to obſerve that which is commanded
by the Law, and do not ſatisfie their Duty if they
are prepared to undergo the Penalty ordained by
the Law; But if it be manifeſt that he intended
not to oblige them, but only to the Penalty, it is
certain that the Subjects are not bound beyond that
Penalty. The Reaſon is, becauſe the Foundation
or Ground of the Obligation of the Law (as elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
is ſhewed) is the manifeſted will of the
Law-maker inveſted with a Lawful power,
Therefore where the Will of the Law-maker
which is the <hi>adaequate Meaſure</hi> of that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
which the Law induceth, is manifeſt;
we need not to make any further doubt concerning
the extent of the Obligation.</p>
            <p>XVI. Peradventure, you will demand, what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
may ſuffice, that a Subject may be ſecure
in his Conſcience, that ſufficiently he underſtands
the mind, and intention of the Law-maker? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<hi>that a mathemat calcertitude,</hi> which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by Demonſtration, and impoſſible to be falſe, is
in va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to be expected <hi>in morals,</hi> by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:154344:164"/>
variety of Circumſtances, and uncertainty of
Humane affairs, nevertheleſs a certain <hi>logical</hi> certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
may oftentimes be had of the Intention of the
Law-maker, which is to be collected from the words
of the Law it ſelf, from which, his Intention may ſo
perſpicuouſly appear, that there needeth not any
further Evidence. The mind of the Legiſlator may be
manifeſted, partly by the form and manner of the
Precept he enjoyneth, and partly by the greatneſs
of the Puniſhment that is to be inflicted, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from the Preface of the Law it ſelf, in which
that it may be more acceptable to the people, he
uſeth to declare the cauſes and reaſons that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to the making of that Law, as alſo how juſt
it is, and neceſſary for the taking away of abuſes, and
for the advantage of the Common-wealth; From
all which being rightly weighed together by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of the circumſtances, it will be no great
difficulty for a wiſe and apprehenſive man, ſo
to learn the meaning and intention of the Lawgiver,
and to have ſuch a ſufficient <hi>moral</hi> certitude thereof,
(for in morals, a moral certitude is ſufficient) as
to conclude, that undoubtedly he intended ſuch a
thing in the making of it; But if the Subject be not
of ſo great an apprehenſion and Judgment, as duly
to examine all the importances of the reaſons, or if
he be afraid (ſince every man is not a Competent
Judge in his own Cauſe) left he might interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the mind of the Law-giver more favourably on
his ſide than he ought to do, it would be his beſt
courſe (if it be a buſineſs of ſo great Importance,
that it will be very uncommodious or troubleſome
to him to obſerve that which by Law is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
to addreſſe himſelf to ſome man of approved
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:154344:164"/>
Piety and Prudence, and plainly, and ſincerely to
declare his mind unto him, and to acquieſce in his
opinion, and his judgment.</p>
            <p>XVII. But becauſe it may be, and oftentimes it
ſo comes to paſſe, that after all diligence there can
be obtained but little certainty of the mind of the
Law-maker from the Law it ſelf, or not ſo much
as the Conſcience of a good man may ſafely acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce
therein; We muſt ſeek further in ſo doubtfull
a caſe, &amp; examine what interpretation we are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in ſo doubtfull a caſe, whether that which is the
more large &amp; favourable, as many will have it, or as
others, the ſtricter interpretation; <hi>Martin Navar</hi>
a man of great authority amongſt the Canoniſts, is
ſaid to be of an opinion, that he thought no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Law did oblige to the <hi>fault, by it ſelf,</hi> but only
to the <hi>penalty.</hi> Other Authors have been of another
judgment, and have taught, that every penal Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
by the mind of the Law-maker it was manifeſt
to the contrary, did oblige to the fault alſo. I muſt
confeſs that the <hi>extremes</hi> of both opinions have
been always ſuſpected by me, &amp; it may ſo come to
paſs, that as ſome have ſpoken too favourably, ſo
others too ſeverely. That therefore in a thing So
dubious we may have ſomething to follow which is
certain, let this be the ſecond Concluſion, <hi>A Law
purely penal, doth by it ſelf, and ordinarily, oblige
only unto the penalty, and not unto the fault.</hi> I ſay in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the firſt place a Law purely penal, whether it be
<hi>categorically</hi> taken or <hi>disjunctively.</hi> I ſay in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
place, <hi>by it ſelf,</hi> for by accident, and by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of a former obligation, it may oblige to
the <hi>fault</hi> alſo; for a penal Law is made to that end,
that Subjects by fear of puniſhment be compelled

               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:154344:166"/>
to their Duties, to which they were bound before
by a former Law, <hi>divine, natural,</hi> or <hi>humane,</hi> ſo
thoſe penal Laws (he that killeth a man let him
ſuffer the pains of Death; He that tranſporteth
Merchandize beyond the Seas, let him either pay
the Cuſtom, or loſe his Merchandize) do oblige
to the fault, ſo that whoſoever ſhall undergo
the puniſhment ſhall not clear his Conſcience
thereby, unleſs he ſhall obey the precept of the Law,
but they do not bind ſo, <hi>by themſelves</hi> and by <hi>their
own virtue,</hi> but by the force of a precedent obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that taketh its riſe from the command of a
former Law. For the Subject was obliged before
that Law (according to our ſuppoſition,) was made,
both by the Law of God not to commit murder,
and by the Law of his Country to pay cuſtomes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and taxes. I ſay in the third place, <hi>Ordinarily,</hi>
becauſe it may be done <hi>extraordinarily,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate and condition of things ſo requiring, ſo
that what otherwiſe was free, and might be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
may in an exigence fall out ſo neceſſary to be
done, that he may offend, and fail in his office if
he doth not do it, but <hi>ordinarily,</hi> theſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
caſes being excepted, he who is prepared to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the puniſhment impoſed by the Law, is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bound by that Law, if the Law be purely penal.</p>
            <p>XVIII. The reaſon of the whole Concluſion is,
becauſe the maker of Lawes doth not oblige but by
commanding, and therefore a <hi>ſimple ordination</hi>
which commandeth nothing doth no more oblige
of it ſelf, than the Counſel of a friend, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of a grave man; For as he who giveth
Counſel to another, or doth exhort him to do <hi>this</hi> or
<hi>that,</hi> doth declare what it is that he deſireth him
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:154344:166"/>
to do, but doth neither oblige him to it, nor intend
to oblige him: ſo a <hi>Legiſlator</hi> in that Law in which he
commandeth not any thing of the Subject, but only
ſhews him what he would have him to act, under the
Condition of a propoſed puniſhment, is to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
not to have a will to oblige him further, but only
to the penalty he propoſed; For if he had an Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to oblige him to the <hi>fault</hi> alſo, it had been
moſt eaſy for him by adding a command to ſignifie
his intention ſo unto him. Therefore ſeeing that a
ſimple and bare ordination doth not <hi>it ſelf</hi> oblige
unto the fault, and the addition of a <hi>temporal penalty</hi>
cannot of it ſelf oblige but only to the undergoing
of the <hi>temporal penalty,</hi> it is manifeſt, that a Law
<hi>purely penal,</hi> which containeth nothing <hi>in it ſelf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a <hi>bare ordination</hi> and temporal penalty annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it, neither of which is obligatory to the fault,
cannot of it ſelf oblige unto the fault, but unto the
<hi>puniſhment</hi> alſo. And the ſame is to be ſpoken of
thoſe Laws which are called <hi>conventional,</hi> which
example I the more willingly do uſe, becauſe it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not only to confirm, but excellently to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
our Concluſion To which alſo may be added
the will of the Teſtator, and many other things,
which as to the power of obligation are all of a
like nature. The Inhabitants of ſome Town, who
have not the power to make Laws, properly ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
do yet in the <hi>Court of the Lord of the Mannor</hi>
(for ſo they term it) debate and agree amongſt

mulct</hi> is impoſed on thoſe who ſhall violate
the <hi>agreement,</hi> theſe conventions are called the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:154344:167"/>
               <hi>Laws of the Inhabitants,</hi> and in our own language
<hi>BY LAWES,</hi> for learned men and skilful in
antiquity, do note that in the antient language of
the Saxons, the monoſyllable <hi>BY,</hi> doth ſignifie
a habitation; We with many others, for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſake, do call theſe Laws <hi>conventional Laws,</hi>
for although they be contracts only, and conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
amongſt private perſons, and to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
not Laws, by reaſon of the defect of the
publick Authority, yet they are commonly called
Laws, by reaſon of the Analogy which they have
with Laws properly ſo called, and as to thoſe two
effects of the Laws, of <hi>directing</hi> and <hi>obliging;</hi> for
as the Lawes do direct the Subjects, ſo thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
do direct the Perſons confenting in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and do oblige them to the performance of what
they are to act, and certain it is, that in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
the perſons contracting did not intend mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to oblige themſelves to the <hi>Fault,</hi> but only
to the Penalty; For Example ſake, The <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>
of ſome village do agree amongſt themſelves,
that the Maſters of every Family in that village ſhall
every year in the Month of <hi>May</hi> work in their own
perſons three days for the repairing of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
and they who ſhall not do ſo, (ſuppoſe
here that every days work is valued at ten pence)
ſhall have a <hi>mulct</hi> upon them to pay twenty pence;
It is certain by this conventional Law, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who did contract it, did chiefly intend the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repairing of the High-ways, &amp; moreover they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that every Maſter of his Family ſhould labour in
his own perſon for ſo profitable a work, otherwiſe
they would not agree upon a mulct, that they who
refuſed ſhould pay as much again as the days work
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:154344:167"/>
came unto; And as certain it is on the otherſide,
that they intended not mutually to oblige them
ſelves any further than to the paying of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>mulct,</hi> if any one of them either by the reaſon
of other imployments could not, or upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretences whatſoever, would not in his own
perſon perform that work.<note place="margin">Imperia mortuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. <hi>Senec. 3. Contr. v.</hi> 9. Legatum est quod legis modo teſtamento relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur VLV. <hi>Inſtitu. Cap.</hi>

Widdow, ſhall retain the houſes with the adjacent

of <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ias,</hi> that his wife ſhould remain a widdow, and
ſhould not marry again, for in that <hi>Intention</hi> he
annexed that <hi>Condition</hi> by the fear of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to deterre his wife from a ſecond Mariage,
And by inſerting that Condition, he intended not,
and indeed could not intend to oblige his wife to
the <hi>Fault,</hi> as to have offended if ſhe ſhould have
marryed another Husband.</p>
            <p>XIX. But you will allege, Agreements do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige,
and Wills and Teſtaments do oblige to the
<hi>fault,</hi> for he offendeth who ſtandeth not to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
he hath made, And thoſe offend who do
otherwiſe than by the will of the Dead is ordered;
I anſwer, that the Caſe is far different to violate
Contracts, Laws, or the Wills of the Dead, and
to infringe the <hi>will</hi> of a Legiſlator, or a Teſtator
made under a Condition; How great the difference
is, the Examples which before we have produced
will beſt of all inform us. He doth not preſently
tranſgreſſe againſt that conventional Law of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:154344:168"/>
for three days under a pecuniary Mulct, who
refuſeth to work, unleſſe he refuſeth alſo to pay
the Mulct; For he ſtands to what was agreed
upon, if he performeth either, and that alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intention of thoſe who made the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who intended indeed mutually to oblige
themſelves to the performance of that work, but not
ſimply &amp; abſolutely, but under the condition above
ſpecified; So in that <hi>Teſtamentary Law</hi> of <hi>Caia</hi> marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another Husband, <hi>Caius</hi> being dead, ſhe offendeth
not by marrying, although it be certain that the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
had rather, and indeed willed (for he who <hi>had
rather, willeth</hi>) that ſhe ſhould not marry, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſhe ſhould undoubtedly offend if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now marryed unto another, ſhe ſhould ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Lands and Houſes upon ſuch a condition
bequeathed to her in the Will, and ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
them to the Heir. The reaſon of both the
examples is the ſame, becauſe in both of them the
obligation was not <hi>pure, ſimple,</hi> and <hi>abſolute,</hi> but
only <hi>conditinal;</hi> For always a <hi>condition</hi> of its own
nature, doth ſuſpend the <hi>obligation,</hi> ſo that the
condition being kept, the obligation immediately,
as if the Bonds were looſed, doth fall to the
Ground. The Caſe is the very ſame in Laws that
are purely penal, as to the <hi>manner,</hi> and <hi>meaſure of
obliging,</hi> which they will eaſily underſtand who have
the will and the leiſure to compare theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
amongſt themſelves, ſo that we need not any
longer to inſiſt in the explication of them.</p>
            <p>XX. But peradventure ſome one may yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that no man can be obliged to the <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but he muſt be obliged to the <hi>Fault</hi> alſo,
for a <hi>Penalty</hi> cannot juſtly be impoſed on any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:154344:168"/>
for ſome antecedent <hi>Fault,</hi> according to that of
St. <hi>Auguſtin, Omnis poena ſi juſta eſt, peccati poena eſt;
Every puniſhment, if it be juſt, is the puniſhment of
ſome ſin.</hi> The ſecond objection is derived from
the Nature of the Law, they urge, which is to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand
ſomething, therfore that Law which we have
ſaid is <hi>purely penal,</hi> hath not the Nature of a Law if it
commands nothing, or if implicitly at leaſt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
ſome Command, it muſt alſo oblige unto
the <hi>Fault,</hi> for a fault is nothing elſe but a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
or a Violation of a juſt Command.</p>
            <p>XXI. To the firſt objection we may anſwer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways, For in the firſt place it may truly be
ſaid, that indeed <hi>eternal Puniſhment</hi> as it is under
the abſolute Notion of Puniſhment, and cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
be conſidered but in the true Nature of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
muſt therfore neceſſarily ſuppoſe ſome
antecedent fault which hath deſerved it, and for
which without any other reſpect whatſoever, he
who is guilty of that Fault, is afflicted with the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
but there is not the ſame conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all <hi>ſpiritual Puniſhments,</hi> much more in
<hi>temporal Puniſhments;</hi> For although both of them
as it is a Puniſhment, doth ſuppoſe ſome precedent
fault worthy of ſuch a Puniſhment, for otherwiſe
it would not be juſt, yet becauſe they may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
conſidered, than under the bare notion
of a puniſhment, <hi>viz.</hi> In reſpect to the <hi>End</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntended by the <hi>party puniſhing</hi> (that is, not ſo much
as ordinated to revenge a fault paſt, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a fault to come) it comes thereupon to paſſe,
that neither God himſelf when he afflicts a man
either with a ſpiritual or a temporal puniſhment,
neither man when he inflicts upon a man a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:154344:169"/>
puniſhment, doth always preciſely reſpect their
Sins or offences, but very often they do propound
other ends unto themſelves. To this purpoſe
belongeth that anſwer of our Saviour, when
his Diſciples asked him concerning the blind man,
whether it were for his Sins, or his Fathers that he
was born blind? <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 3. His anſwer was, that
neither his Sins, nor his Fathers were the occaſion
of his blindneſſe, <hi>but that the works of God might be
manifeſted in him;</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe in <hi>morals,</hi>
the Eſtimation of things, and the Denomination
of them, is taken rather from the <hi>final,</hi> than
from the <hi>efficient,</hi> and <hi>meritorious Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXII. Secondly, it may be ſaid, that the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>temporal puniſhment</hi> to a Sin, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
conſiſt only in that puniſhment which <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
is oppoſed to the Sin, and not in that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which only <hi>contrarily</hi> is oppoſed to it, which
is the looſer and more improper ſignification of
<hi>the word.</hi> We have heretofore made uſe of this
diſtinction, and explained it in the ſecond <hi>Praecogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance</hi>
to this <hi>Doubt,</hi> therefore there needs no repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of it; It may ſuffice to put you in mind, that
the <hi>puniſhment</hi> affixed to the Law that is <hi>purely
penal,</hi> is not called a puniſhment, <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> and
<hi>properly,</hi> but <hi>improperly,</hi> and more <hi>largely,</hi> as it
ſignifies another kind of <hi>Evil,</hi> diverſe from the
<hi>Evil</hi> of the <hi>Fault,</hi> which kind of puniſhment may
be infflicted on a perſon without any legal injuſtice,
and for a <hi>profitable end,</hi> as to avoid ſome publick
Inconvenience, without the delinquency of the
perſon ſuffering, for the word <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſo
taken doth contain all <hi>loſſes, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>fortunes,</hi> or <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,</hi>
or whatſoever befalls a man which he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:154344:169"/>
deſireth might never have to come to paſs.</p>
            <p>XXIII. If theſe things ſhall not ſatisfie the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
yet this will be very remarkable which here in
the third place I ſhall propound unto you, and
which will quite remove all this Doubt, and very
aptly meet with another objection, which is, that
the Intent of a penal Law (of which we now ſpeak)
being to <hi>oblige the Subject,</hi> and yet but <hi>condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
to oblige him, may be conſidered two or three
ways; Firſt, preciſely, as <hi>to that to which</hi> it intendeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to oblige under ſuch a condition to be done. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
as preciſely to the condition it ſelf, by
which it intendeth to oblige, the one whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the ordination of the Law, and the other
the puniſhment annexed to it. Thirdly, as to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
whole <hi>aggregate,</hi> that is the whole Law it ſelf,
which at once conſiſteth of the complexion of
them both. This diſtinction being laid down, I
ſay in the firſt place, that that part of the Law
which containeth only the condition or the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth not of it ſelf oblige <hi>unto the fault,</hi> for a
bare condition is of no prevalence, as all do grant,
and it is manifeſt of it ſelf; He doth not therefore
tranſgreſs, nay rather he very well performs his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
who avoids the penalty of the Law, provided he
performeth that which the Law ordaineth. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
I affirm, that that part of the Law which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the ordination, doth not of it ſelf oblige un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fault, for no Law obligeth beyond the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Law-giver, &amp; certain it is that the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator</hi>
by that part of the Law did not intend, <hi>per
ſe</hi> or <hi>by it ſelf,</hi> to oblige the Subject <hi>to the fault,</hi> for
then it had intended to have <hi>obliged him ſimply,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
that part, taken <hi>preciſely</hi> and by it ſelf, doth contain
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:154344:170"/>
no condition in it; but by the condition of the Law
added in the other part, it is manifeſt that he did
not intend <hi>ſimply to oblige</hi> to the doing of <hi>that</hi>
which the Law ordaineth, but under a condition
in that Law expreſſed. I ſay thirdly, that a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Law</hi> taken <hi>wholy</hi> and <hi>joyntly</hi> doth oblige to the
<hi>Fault,</hi> in this ſenſe, that he is guilty of the Fault,
and ſinneth againſt the Law, who when he ought
to obſerve both parts, performeth neither; For as
amongſt <hi>Logicians,</hi> the truth of a diſjunctive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
depends upon the truth of ſome one part
of it, ſo that it is all of it <hi>true,</hi> if either of the
parts of it be <hi>true,</hi> and not falſe unleſs both parts
of it be falſe; So in <hi>morals,</hi> he obſerveth a diſjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
Law (and every Law <hi>purely penal</hi> is <hi>diſjunctive,</hi>
or <hi>formally,</hi> or <hi>equivalently,</hi>) who performeth
one of the two parts propounded, and he doth
not violate the Law, unleſs he doth neglect
them both.</p>
            <p>XXIV. This which was to be ſpoken of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of a Law <hi>purely penal,</hi> being as I conceive
ſufficiently unfolded, let us now paſſe to the
conſideration of a <hi>penal Law mixed;</hi> Concerning
which I make this my third concluſion; <hi>A penal
Law mixed</hi> (to wit, which openly commandeth
ſomething to be obſerved, and that it more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
may be performed which is commanded,
doth appoint a penalty to the tranſgreſſors) doth
oblige both to the <hi>fault,</hi> and to the <hi>puniſhment,</hi>
inſomuch that he neither ſatisfies the <hi>Law,</hi> nor
his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> who undergoes the puniſhment,
unleſs he doth perform that alſo which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Law. There is none can doubt
that ſuch a Law doth oblige to the <hi>puniſhment,</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:154344:170"/>
for otherwiſe of what uſe would the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be that is added to it; And it is manifeſt that
it obligeth to the <hi>fault,</hi> becauſe it containeth a
manifeſt command; And every command obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to the <hi>fault.</hi> For a Fault, or a Sin, is nothing
elſe but the tranſgreſſion of ſome precept, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
3. Neither can that be probably ſpoken, which is
ſaid to be the opinion of <hi>Navarr,</hi> that the Law-maker
by inſerting the puniſhment, doth ſignify,
that he hath no intention of obliging, but only to
that <hi>puniſhment</hi> which is annexed. Obſerve I pray
you, how perverſe it is, ſo to interpret the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a puniſhment, which it is certain is for that
end annexed to the precept, that the ſaid precept
by the fear of puniſhment, might more diligently,
and more accurately be obſerved, as to make
weak, and take-away the obligation of the ſaid
precept. Numberleſſe are the Laws which
throughout the world are made againſt Thieves,
Murderers, perjured Perſons, and other wicked
and nefarious people; God alſo gave a Law to
our firſt Parents, by which he forbad them to eat
of the fruit of the Tree which was in the midſt of
Paradiſe, having annexed to the prohibition, the
puniſhment of death, if they ſhould eat thereof;
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Can any man be found ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtitute of
reaſon as to think that <hi>Adam</hi> was obliged by this
<hi>Divine Law,</hi> and that others are obliged by <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws,</hi> to the <hi>puniſhment</hi> only, and not unto
the <hi>fault?</hi> Who will affirm (to omit humane
Laws) that <hi>Adam</hi> was not obliged in Conſcience
by that Divine Law to abſtain from the forbidden
fruit, but to this only, that if he did eat thereof,
he ſhould be ready to undergoe the ſetence of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:154344:171"/>
death? The opinion therefore of <hi>Navarre</hi> being
exploded as dangerous, and by all men confuted,
(if indeed the opinion was his, which I ſhall hardly
believe, he being a man of ſo reverend a fame) we
are to affirm, that a penal Law mixed, being both pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and preceptive, doth oblige both to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to the Fault, to the puniſhment as it is
penal, and to the Fault as it is preceptive.</p>
            <p>XXV. The third Doubt remaineth; How,
and how far the tranſgreſſor of a penal Law is
bound to undergoe the puniſhment in the fact it
ſelf that is appointed by the Law? I muſt make
haſte, I will therefore be as ſhort as I can; I ſay
therefore in the firſt place, if the puniſhment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the Law be ſuch that it impoſeth not
any thing upon the tranſgreſſor to be either done
or ſuffered by him, but conſiſteth rather in an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability</hi>
to do ſomething which was commodious
for him to do, or in an incapacity of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomthing which would be profitable for
him, he is guilty of the Law ſo violated,
and is bound <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to undergo the puniſhment.
There are many Laws which do forbid tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
to do this or that, as the Civil Laws for certain
cauſes do forbid <hi>tranſlationem Dominii, the alteration
of power or free-holds;</hi> There are alſo many Laws
which for ſuch a certain time, do make Delinquents
incapable of ſuch a place, or dignity; As if a Diſturber
of the peace, by a ſtatute of the Univerſity, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to have his <hi>Grace</hi> propounded in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
Houſe for the ſpace of two years after
the fault committed; In ſuch &amp; the like caſes, where
the puniſhment conſiſteth only in the <hi>Inability,</hi> or
the <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pacity,</hi> becauſe to undergoe this puniſhment
there is no <hi>Cooperation</hi> required of the perſon to be
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:154344:171"/>
puniſhed, but rather a certain Ceſſation of <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
He who hath violated the Law, is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
willingly to ſuffer the puniſhment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
he be not required; I ſay in the ſecond
place, if the puniſhment appointed by the Law be
ſuch, that a <hi>cooperation</hi> of the perſon offending be
neceſſarily required to the Execution of the Law,
that is, that he who is to be puniſhed is to
act ſomething himſelf in his own puniſhment,
he is not obliged <hi>ordinarily</hi> to undergoe the ſaid
puniſhment <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> before the Judge hath
pronounced the ſentence, or which is the ſame,
before the puniſhment be exacted of him, by
a perſon to that purpoſe inveſted with lawful
Authority; The guilty perſon is bound indeed
to ſuffer the puniſhment, but if he called to it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
otherwiſe he is not bound. I ſay in the third
place, that a guilty man, after the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by the Judge, or after he is required to it
by a perſon inveſted with lawful Authority, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to a willing undergoing of the puniſhment,
yea, and with ſome Cooperation of his own,
if this Cooperation be not againſt the Laws
of humanity, though otherwiſe very grievous,
and extremely painful. For examples ſake,
If an offendor be commanded to pay a great
ſum of money, under the name of penalty,
or to depart the Kingdome, he is bound by
the power of the Law to the performance of
it: but if the puniſhment impoſed be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grievous, but ſomething alſo that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane,
as if a malefactor be commanded to
ſcourge himſelf, to cut off his own hand,
to drinke poyſon, or the like, in theſe caſes
the guilty perſon is obliged to undergoe the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:154344:172"/>
puniſhment <hi>paſſively,</hi> but he is not obliged <hi>actively</hi>
to cooperate in it, w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> he knows to be ordained by
the Law, and which by his default he hath deſerved;
And let this ſuffice to be ſpoken of the neceſſity of
the Promulgation of Laws, and of the Obligation of
thoſe <hi>penal Laws</hi> which may ſeem to have any
reference with the Formal Cauſe of Laws.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N our former Lectures we have
treated of the Obligation of
<hi>Humane Laws,</hi> as to their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
Efficient, and formal
Cauſes,</hi> in ſome places perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
more largely, and in
others again peradventure more conciſely
than was requiſite; It remaineth, that we ſhould
proceed to the explication of thoſe things which
do pertain to the <hi>final Cauſe</hi> of Laws; But before
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:154344:173"/>
we do come to diſſolve theſe doubts, we are firſt to
premiſe, and pronounce as an undoubted Truth,
<hi>That the ultimate end of the Laws, is the good of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Commonalty,</hi> or the publick peace and tranquillity;
This is proved firſt from thoſe very words of the
Apoſtle, <hi>that we may live a quiet &amp; a peaceable life.</hi>
The Apoſtle doth here exhort, that both private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but eſpecially in publick Congregations (for ſo
I conceive this place to be underſtood, and the
beſt Interpreters are of the ſame opinion with me)
Requeſts, Prayers, and Supplications, with
thanksgivings, may be made, as firſt for all men in
general, out of Charity, and in order to a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
end, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal happineſs in the life to come,
as they are men, and either in <hi>Act,</hi> or in <hi>Power,</hi>
Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, ſo more
eſpecially for Kings and others inveſted with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, and this out of Prudence, and
in order to a Temporal end, to wit, external fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
in this preſent life, as they are the chief
Members of the <hi>body politicks,</hi> from whoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative,
and executive power, accordingly as
they have adminiſtred it, whether rightly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,
either the chief happineſs, or unhappineſs
of the reſt of the Members, and by conſequence
of the whole Body, doth depend; <hi>Therefore the
making of Laws being the chief Act of the ſupreme
political Juriſdiction,</hi> that which is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<hi>End</hi> of that ſupreme <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> is alſo
the ſupreme <hi>End</hi> of the making of Laws, to wit,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the good of the Commonalty; It is proved ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
from the Nature of the <hi>End,</hi> as by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<hi>a priori;</hi> That, in its order, is the <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
End</hi> of everything, to which all the <hi>Acts</hi>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:154344:173"/>
of that thing are reduced,<note place="margin">

principle,</hi> and to which they are referred as to
that for whoſe ſake they are <hi>ultimately</hi> ordained,
Therefore the Final Cauſe is commonly called by
<hi>Ariſtotle That for which;</hi> But all the <hi>Acts</hi> of Laws,
are regulated by the <hi>Common good,</hi> as by their
firſt Rule and Principle, and are referred to the
<hi>Common good,</hi> as to that for whoſe ſake they are
made, as may appear by running over the ſeveral
<hi>Acts,</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For wherefore are good
things commanded, or evil ones forbidden, and
things indifferent, and of a middle Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?
Or wherefore are Rewards decreed to
men that have deſerved well of the Common-wealth?
or wherefore are puniſhments appointed
to the Violators of Laws? or wherefore are the
Laws in the Courts indifferently pleaded unto
both? of which thoſe are the <hi>firſt Acts</hi> of
Laws, and by the way of <hi>Form,</hi> and the other
more <hi>remote,</hi> and by the way of <hi>Effect;</hi> Is it not for
that end, that the Common-wealth may flouriſh in
peace and ſafety, and that private men according
to their meaſure and degrees, may partake, rejoyce,
in the publick happineſſe, in a word, that they
may be all inſervient to the <hi>Common good?</hi> Thirdly,
it is proved <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> from the <hi>poſterior,</hi> by the
ſence and conſent of all men; For the Law-makers
who do decree juſt judgements, do indeed appear,
and thoſe who meditate on <hi>Evil</hi> as a <hi>Law,</hi>
do notwithſtanding deſire to ſeem to have an Eye
to the <hi>Common good</hi> and profit in the making of
their Laws, and to preferr the publick intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their own; Whether they ſincerely intend,
or craftily pretend, they all profeſſe that in
the making of their Laws, their chiefeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:154344:174"/>
was the publick Good.</p>
            <p>II. This foundation of the preſent diſcourſe
being laid, to wit, That the End of Laws is the
good of the Common-wealth, I proceed to the
<hi>Doubts,</hi> whereof let this be the firſt, Whether
there be any neceſſary uſe at leaſt of Humane
Laws? And indeed we ſhould not have needed
to have made any <hi>Doubt</hi> of it, did not the mad er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Anabaptiſts, and ſome others of their
faction, make this buſineſſe for us, from whoſe
Principles, ſeeing they affirm, it is not lawful for
a man that is a Chriſtian to be a Magiſtrate, or to
contend by war, or by ſutes in Law, to ſwear, or to
adminiſter an oath to any one, it ſeems to follow,
that there is no need at all of Humane Laws;
For take away but Juriſdiction, there will be no
man to make Laws, and take away the Seats,
and Courts of Juſtice, there will be no man that
will fear them. What need ſad complaints, if the
offence be not redreſſed by puniſhment, what
will vain Laws profit without the execution of
them? The Directive power of the Law muſt of
neceſſity fall unto the ground, if the Coactive
power doth not aſſiſt it. The reaſon of this Doubt
is, for the Law of Nature may ſuffice to leave the
Gentiles inexcuſable, which dictates to them to
eſchew all Sins, and treſpaſſes, to injure no man,
and the like; But if that be defective, the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian
hath at hand a more ſublime, and a more
perfect Law, to wit, the Law of Faith, Juſtice,
and Charity, made by our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
whom St. <hi>James</hi> acknowledgeth to be the only
Judge and Law-giver.<note place="margin">James. 4. 12.</note> This place in my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth neerly touch our Innovatours, who
have derived and drawn moſt of their opinion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:154344:174"/>
from the unclean wells of the Anabaptiſts, whilſt
they collect from that place of the Apoſtle, that
it is lawful for no man beſides Chriſt alone to
make Eccleſiaſtical Laws, for it no wayes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
either by the force of the words, or by the
ſcope and order of the whole <hi>perioch,</hi> that the
Apoſtle hath ſpoke more there of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
Laws,</hi> then of <hi>Civil;</hi> And unleſs they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deal <hi>unfaithfuly</hi> and <hi>deceitfuly</hi> with us, than
be ruled by reaſon, they muſt do one of theſe two
things, which they pleaſe, either turn abſolute
Anabaptiſts, and take away altogether from
mankind all the power of making Laws, or grant
unto ſupreme Magiſtrates, as it is fit they ſhould,
the power of making Eccleſiaſtical Laws.</p>
            <p>III. But how theſe our Brethren can diſintangle
themſelves from the ſnares of the Anabaptiſts, it
doth not much concern us, let them look unto it
themſelves; We eaſily do anſwer, that the Law
of Nature is written in our hearts, and the Law of
Chriſt is revealed in the Goſpel, and that both of
them in their kind are moſt perfect, but ſo, that
for all that, it is moſt manifeſt that the profit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Lawes is very great, and their uſe as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Becauſe thoſe divine Laws do contain only
<hi>general Principles</hi> of things to be done, From
which, as <hi>Concluſions</hi> from their <hi>Principles,</hi>
more <hi>ſpecial Rules</hi> are to be deduced, accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the right Inſtitution of <hi>publick Societies,</hi> &amp; of
the manners of ſingle perſons. Neither is it any way
to be feared that it may derogate at all from the
perfection of the Law of God; For the makers of
humane Laws do not go about to add any new ſtock
to the moſt rich Treaſure of the divine Law, but
they rather take from thence what they judge moſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:154344:175"/>
profitable to themſelves, and to their people, and
the good of the Common-wealth; Humane Laws
therfore, if they are juſt, are nothing elſe but the
Relicts of the Law of God, that is, particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of the <hi>general Rules</hi> which the Law of
Nature, and the word of God have exhibited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinatly,
wiſely accommodated to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
&amp; Utility of certain people, according to the
conſideration of Times, and Places. For Examples
ſake, The Law of Nature doth teach in general,
that we are to offer an Injury to no man, and he
who doth ſo is bound to make reſtitution; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to the ſpecialty, what injury he hath done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his neighbour who hath broke down the Hedge,
and let in his Cattel into his Grounds, and what is
the reſtitution to be made for ſuch an Injury, is
not determined by the Law of Nature, but by the
Civil Law; And the Scripture doth openly hold
forth, that wicked men are to be puniſhed by the
Magiſtrate. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and in other places;
But what kind of wickedneſſe the Magiſtrate
is to puniſh, what puniſhment to afflict, and
after what proportion, is no where defined in
the Law of God; Power being tranſmitted to
Princes &amp; Law-makers, by God, to define of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by Laws well conſtituted, what accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to their wiſdome they ſhall find moſt ſafe and
profitable to the Common-wealth; The Rights
therefore and the Laws of God, and of a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and a Judge, are diſtinct, and proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and diſpoſed in ſo excellent an order, that
the Precepts and Commandments of God, which
are general, and indeterminate, are by the Law-maker
determined, and accommodated to certain
Species of perſons, and actions, and being ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:154344:175"/>
by the Laws, the Judge doth effectually ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply
them to the particular cauſes of perſons, &amp; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
ſo that if a Legiſlator ſhould make a Law
which is not complacent to the Law of God, he is
to be adjudged to have made an unrighteous Law,
and if a Judge in any particular Cauſe ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Sentence which is not congruous to the
Law conſtituted by the Prince, he is to be judged
himſelf to have pronounced an unjuſt Sentence.</p>
            <p>IV The ſecond Doubt is, whether a Law-maker
be obliged, if poſſibly he can effect it, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all the acts, and offices of all Virtues, and
to forbid all Sins of whatſoever nature they are,
or if he cannot all, whether he be bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and forbid as many of both kinds as poſſibly
he can? The Reaſon of the Doubt is, becauſe
there is nothing more conducing to the proper
end of the Law, which is the <hi>common good,</hi> than
as much as poſſibly may be, that all the Citizens
may be good, and none of them evil. Therefore
it is the part of a Law-maker, who always is to have
before his eys this end which is the common good,
to take all poſſible care he can, to command the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all <hi>Acts</hi> of all Vertues, that ſo all his Citizens
may be good, &amp; to forbid all Sins whatſoever, that
there be no unrighteouſneſſe amongſt them; and the
two chief of the Apoſtles doe ſeem to require this of
the political Magiſtrate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath
theſe words, <hi>Do good and thou ſhalt have Praiſe,
but if thou dost evil, fear, for the Magiſtrate is
a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evil,</hi>
that is, on him who doth any manner of evil; And
St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, ſecond Chapter, and
fourteenth verſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:154344:176"/>
               <hi>for the puniſhment of evil doer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
but the Praiſe of them that do well,</hi> that is, of all well-doers,
and of all evil-doers; For that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>indefinitely</hi> is <hi>equipollent</hi> to an <hi>univerſal</hi> &amp;
it is conſonant to the Rule of the <hi>Logicians,</hi> (in a
neceſſary matter) and to the will of God, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
the Magiſtrate the acceptation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>V. For anſwer, I ſay firſt, and generally that
the Law-maker is bound to uſe his utmoſt Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that his Citizens be all of them good men,
and none of them evil, and by conſequence to
command all Acts of Vertues, and to forbid all
Vices ſo far, as the Reaſon of the <hi>Beginning from
whom, and the End for which</hi> he worketh, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
but beyond that he hath no obligation at all;
For the <hi>Beginnining</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> in the operations
of all, work they naturally, or work they freely,
are the adaequate meaſure of all <hi>Intermedial Acts,</hi>
ſo far as thoſe Acts are proportionate, &amp; conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
with the Beginning from whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
&amp; with the End to which they tend. The Acts
therefore of <hi>Commanding</hi> and <hi>Forbidding,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in which the Exerciſe of the <hi>legiſlative Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
doth conſiſt, muſt be proportionated both
to their <hi>Beginning</hi> in whoſe Vertue they are done,
to wit, the Higher Powers granted by God, and
to their <hi>End</hi> for whoſe ſake they are done, to wit,
the <hi>Common Good.</hi> A Law-maker therefore ought
ſo far to <hi>command, prohibit, permit,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all other Dutyes, as they are agreeable to the
power granted to him by God, and is expedient
for the Commonalty which God hath committed
to his change.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:154344:176"/>
VI. But theſe conſiderations are general, and
indefinite; To ſatisfie therefore the <hi>Doubt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
we muſt deſcend to ſomething which is
more particular, but which howſoever may rely on
this general foundation. I ſay therefore in the ſecond
place, the <hi>acts</hi> of Virtues and Vices, ſome of them
being internal, of which nature are the freer <hi>acts</hi> of
the <hi>Will,</hi> as <hi>to will</hi> and not <hi>to will,</hi> and the movings
of the affections, to love, to hate, to grieve, and
if there be any other cogitations, and intentions of
the heart, and mind; and ſome of them being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
of which ſort are all the commanded acts
of the will, and the indeliberate motions of the
affections, which are exerciſed by <hi>bodily Organs,</hi> as
to <hi>ſee,</hi> to <hi>ſpeak</hi> to <hi>ſtrike,</hi> to <hi>plunder,</hi> and innumerable
others; the Legiſlative power is only exerciſed on
the <hi>outward acts,</hi> but not on the <hi>inward.</hi> A Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
may therefore command the payment of a debt,
the reſtitution of ſtollen goods, and the outward
worſhip of God; He alſo may forbid Theft, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Manſlaughter, Blaſphemy, and the like;
But he cannot command the loving of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the confidence to be had in God, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the world, nor prohibit the coveting of
his Neighbours goods, unchaſt cogitations, the
hate of his Neighbour, and the Atheiſm of the
heart. The reaſon is, becauſe to determine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
actions is neither proportionate to the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
from which,</hi> nor to the <hi>end for which</hi> the
Legiſlator worketh; For Almighty God hath only
permitted to the Magiſtrate the Government of the
<hi>external man,</hi> and hath reſerved to himſelf alone
the knowledge and judgment of the <hi>inward actions,</hi>
and the inſpection into the hearts of men; for the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:154344:177"/>
               <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and the <hi>Judge</hi> is the ſame, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved by the teſtimony of St. <hi>James,</hi> and
the Legiſlative power would be altogether ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
to obtain its propoſed <hi>end</hi> if it were only <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and <hi>coactive.</hi> Firſt therefore, ſeeing an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Court cannot underſtand, nor judge of inward
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> actions; And ſecondly, ſeeing it were a vain thing
to command or prohibit that by a Law which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when it is committed we are not able to puniſh;
And thirdly, ſeeing the external operation of good
works, and the external declination of evil ones
doth ſuffice to the outward felicity of a Republick,
it followeth, that a Legiſlator, or a Law-maker,
neither wiſely can, nor rightly ought, either to
command, or to forbid the internal actions of
<hi>Virtues</hi> or <hi>Vices.</hi> In which regard, as in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> which requireth
Truth, Purity, Sincerity, in the inward parts,
and reſtraineth and checketh the higheſt and firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
motions of the Will, and puniſheth as
well Sins thought on, as Sins committed, doth moſt
infinitely excell the moſt excellent Laws of men;
And therefore <hi>David</hi> in the 19 <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſaith, that the
Law of God is perfect and undefiled, and the Law
of Chriſt, is as the maker of it is deſcribed to be
in the fourth of <hi>Hebrews, A word lively and mighty
in operation, and ſharper than a two-edged Sword,
and entreth through, even to the dividing aſunder of
of the heart and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and is a Diſcerner of the thoughts and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. I ſay in the third place,, that Humane
Laws may <hi>de Jure,</hi> or <hi>by Right</hi> command
all the <hi>outward Acts</hi> of all Vertues, and forbid all
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:154344:177"/>
the outward works of ſin, but they cannot do it <hi>de
facto.</hi> The Reaſon of the firſt member is, becauſe
there is no external Act of Vertue or of Vice, in
the whole Nature, and in every Species of, it ſo
diſpoſed, but that the commanding or the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it (according to the Condition of <hi>Affairs</hi>
and <hi>Times</hi>) may be <hi>ordinated</hi> to the <hi>publiek good.</hi>
Therefore not only the Acts of Juſtice, properly ſo
called, (as ſome will have it) but the acts alſo of
all other Vertues whatſoever may become the due
object, and matter of the Law; And this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to be the obſervation alſo of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
and if I be not much miſtaken, he giveth Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it in the Acts of <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance;</hi>
As if, by a military Law it were ordained, that none
of the Souldiers ſhould run from his Colours, or
from his ingaging with the Enemy, or throw away his
Arms, or as if, by another a Law of frugality, or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the exceſs in banquetting were prohibited
or as if, there were a Command that none ſhould;
exceed in the bravery of his habit, or in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his retinue, or in the Ornaments of his
Houſe. The Reaſon of the latter member is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is ſo great a variety even of the <hi>Species</hi>
themſelves, much more of the <hi>Degrees,</hi> both of
the Offices of Vertues and the <hi>Acts</hi> of Sin, that
if the Law-makers ſhould provide a Caution for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of them, the very multitude of the Laws
would be a burthen to the Common-wealth not to
be endured.</p>
            <p>VIII. I ſay in the fourth place, that a Law-maker
is not obliged to <hi>this, viz.</hi> To forbid all the <hi>evil</hi> that
he can forbid, or to command all the <hi>good:</hi> It will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that the greateſt and moſt remarkable of both
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:154344:178"/>
kinds are to be contained in the Laws, and which
are ſo conjoyned with ſome extraordinary pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
profit, that unleſs ſomthing were determined
of them, there muſt neceſſarily follow ſome great
and grievous Evil which would prove extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
to the Common-wealth; for amongſt
the luſts of the Fleſh, the Allurements of the world,
the temptations of the Devil, and the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poſitions
of men ſo fruitful of all manner of Iniquities, may
we ſo much as dream of a <hi>Platonick</hi> or an <hi>Eutopian</hi>
Commonwealth; we are to think we have done well
enough, if we ſtick not too deep in the mire; For
it is neceſſary that in every Common-wealth ſome
evils ſhould not be prohibited, but tolerated, and
many good things not commanded, but left to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans diſcretion, and that many things of both
kinds ſhould be paſſed by, by the Laws, leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too unſeaſonably active to remove one evil,
we peradventure make way for more and greater
to ariſe.</p>
            <p>IX. The third Doubt is, concerning the <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Law-giver, <hi>whether,</hi> and <hi>how far</hi> it is
required to the effect of obliging? Which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
If a Prince, out of no foreſight, or intent to
Juſtice, or to the publick good at all, being either
carryed away by hatred, or ambition, and the meer
luſt or ruling, or by avarice, or any other depraved
deſire of an impotent mind, ſhould give a Law to his
Subjects, whether they are bound in Conſcience to
obey it? The anſwer is eaſy, they are obliged to
obey it, if there be no other impediment, that is,
if he who made the Law hath a lawful Power, and
the Law it ſelf be otherwiſe juſt, and according to
the Law of the Nations duely debated, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:154344:178"/>
promulgated; I ſay therefore in the firſt
place, that as in <hi>Artificials,</hi> the End of the work,
and of the perſon wotking, is not always the ſame;
as in the building of a Houſe, the End of the work
(that is of the Houſe) is that it may be a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
habitation for the maſter of it; but the End
of the Carpenter is, that he may get ſome gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
Juſt ſo in a Common-wealth, it may come to
paſſe, that the Law-maker may intend his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and yet the Law it ſelf may tend to the
publick Good.</p>
            <p>X. Peradventure you will object, that an indirect
End or Intention doth always corrupt the work,
and therefore the evil Intention of the Law-maker
doth vitiate the Law which was his work. To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
this objection, I ſay in the ſecond place, that
an evil intention doth always blemiſh the work as
the work ſpeaketh the <hi>action</hi> of the <hi>perſon working,</hi>
but it doth not always blemiſh the work as it is the
<hi>effect of the operation.</hi> Theſe two therefore, the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
it ſelf, and the <hi>Perfection</hi> of it, differ not a little
amongſt themſelves, although they are commonly
called by the ſame Name; In the ſame manner as
the <hi>Effecting</hi> and the <hi>Effect</hi> it ſelf. The building of
the Houſe, and the Houſe builded, are both of
them called the work of the Carpenter, although
the one of them is but an <hi>action tranſient,</hi> and the
other, after the houſe is finiſhed, an <hi>action permanent.</hi>
A bad Intention therefore doth corrupt the work
of the Lawmaker, <hi>that is,</hi> his own Act which makes
the Law, and which for the defect of a good end is
not without fault, but it corrupts not the work of
the Legiſlator, that is the Law made by him, if that
which is commanded by the Law is reducible to the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:154344:179"/>
               <hi>Common good,</hi> So, for all the evil intention of the
Judge, a Sentence pronounced by him either for
favour, or for hatred, is firm and valid, if the ſaid
ſentence in it ſelf conſidered, appeareth not to be
unjuſt. For as rightly St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath it, <hi>poteſt
ex libidine imperantis ſine libidine obtemperari, We
may without any luſt, obey the luſt of the Commander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XI. I ſay in the third place; Suppoſe that a
Law be not only made with an evil intention, but
unprofitable to the publick, nay in ſome ſence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious,
yet the Subject is bound to obey it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it be made by juſt Authority, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Law, or the thing commanded, be ſuch
that it may be done without Sin: The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every man ought to be careful and diligent
in the performance of that which belongs to his own
part,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 5.</note> and not too ſcrupulous of what concerns ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>For every man ſhall bear his own Burthen.</hi> If
a Law-giver ſhall be wanting in his Duty, what is
that to you? Do you perform your Office howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
As for his intentions whether they be right
or not, let himſelf look to it, for he muſt give to
God an account of all his actions and intentions;
And do you look to your ſelf, for if you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to obey him, you ſhall give to the ſame God
an account of your diſobedience.</p>
            <p>XII. The fourth Dout, of <hi>the Changing of
Laws,</hi> if they ſeem to be unprofitable or obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Common-wealth; <hi>whether,</hi> and <hi>how
far</hi> the Change of them is either to be attempted by
the Prince, or to be required, and urged by the
People? The reaſon of the <hi>Doubt</hi> in one reſpect
is, becauſe in a body Civil, as in a body natural,
every change, eſpecially if it be ſudden and great, is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:154344:179"/>
dangerous, and on the other ſide, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Common-wealth that the Laws be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Ariſtot. 4. Phyſ. text. 128.</note> and if
the one doth change, that the other be changed with
them; For anſwer to this, I ſay in the firſt place,
it is certain that the Laws may be changed, yea, and
ſometimes that they ought to be changed, for they
have heretofore been changed with great profit to
the Common-wealth, therefore they may now be
changed again, and may be ſo in all future times,
if occaſion ſhall require, &amp; it ſhall be found profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Commonwealth; And why may not that
be lawful to be done again which hath been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heretofore? There are every day new emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
new inconveniencies, new evils, and if there are
not new Laws made to redreſſe them, there will be
no remedy.<note place="margin">Ariſt. 2.</note> And all men ſaith <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſeek not

               </gap>.<note place="margin">Polit. 8.</note> And if heretofore it were
expedient that a Law ſhould be made becauſe it
was profitable to the Commonwealth, it being
found afterwards by the change of the conditions of
Times and manners to become unprofitable, why is
it not expedient that it ſhould be taken away again?</p>
            <p>XIII. I ſay in the ſecond place; That the change
of particular Laws is not without danger, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be attempted unleſſe it be upon ſome
great and urgent neceſſity. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> acutely and
briefly as his cuſtom is produceth divers reaſons,
2. <hi>Poli.</hi> 8. Theſe three are the chiefeſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Theſe often changes do very much dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from the authority of the Law, and the Law-giver;
As we conceive that perſon to be of a very
ſlender and weak judgement, who for no ſound or
evident reaſon, is eaſily enduced to change his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:154344:180"/>
Secondly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
It maketh the people wanton and petulant
(This is true enough, we not long ſince have had
the experience of it) and apt to fly at any thing, if
they ſhall find their Law-giver eaſy on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and departing from his own right to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
the Votes and unſatisfied deſires of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
Therefore the chief Philoſopher moſt grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and deſervedly doth reprove the Law of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi>
a Law-maker of <hi>Miletum, viz. That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
had diſcovered or found out ſomething pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
to the City, ſhould be recompenced for his
good ſervice, with a publick reward.</hi> This Law
was ſpecious enough at the firſt ſight, and plauſible
to the people, but look throughly into it, and you
will find nothing in it either of <hi>prudence,</hi> or <hi>ſafety,</hi>
or <hi>Advantage;</hi> For what could be found more
dangerous to diſturb the publick Peace, than that
factious men and of a turbulent and cunning Spirit,
under the ſhaddow of a publick good, ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occaſion the ſubverſion of the Laws, but alſo call
in queſtion the <hi>Form</hi> of the whole <hi>Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and obtrude unto the State a new Idaea of
Government, according to the humour of their
own Invention. Do you hear, I beſeech you, a
Philoſopher famous in his times, or rather a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and a foreteller of the manners, and the times
in which now we live?<note place="margin">Grav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Laws being ordained for the removing of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Inconvenience, and being it may come to
paſſe, and oftentimes it doth ſo come to paſſe, that
from this ſuddain Immutation, many and more
grievous Inconveniencies may ariſe, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
at the firſt diſcovered, the moſt grave
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:154344:180"/>
Philoſopher did judge it to be far ſafer to tolerate &amp;
endure ſome Inconveniencies, and thoſe not ſlight
ones neither, in a Common wealth (which may
be avouched of the Church alſo which is a kind of a
Common-wealth) than in pretence of Reformation
either Eccleſiaſtical or Political to cancel old Laws,
&amp; Statutes, &amp; turn all things upſide down; Of a far
different judgment to thoſe of our times were the
wiſe men of former Ages, whoſe Rules &amp; Principles
were as are here theſe folowing <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
<hi>Malum benè poſitum non eſt movendum; Imperiti
medici eſt pejus malo remedium adhibere; an Evil well
placed is not to be removed; It is the part of an unskilful
Phyſician to apply a Remedy worſe than the diſeaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIV. I ſay in the third place, That although
the changing of Laws may ſeem to be neceſſary,
by reaſon of ſome great, and evident Cauſe, yet
it is not to be attempted by the people, without
the conſent of the Prince, but modeſtly they
are to crave, and patiently to expect it of him;
and this may aptly be collected from the <hi>Analogy</hi>
of the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>Members,</hi> for how like a
monſter were it, and deſtructive to the whole
body, if the Arms, the Breaſt, or the Feet
ſhould aſſume unto themſelves the office of the
Head? This is abundantly enough demonſtrated
in thoſe things which not long ſince we declared
to you, when we ſpake of the <hi>efficient Cauſe</hi> of
Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> That the principal Act of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
cannot be exerciſed but by him only who
is the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> of the whole Commonalty;
Therefore the Conſtitution, the abrogation, and
any Immutation of Laws whatſoever, which are
all of them the <hi>principal</hi> Acts of the chiefeſt <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:154344:181"/>
cannot pertain unto the people, unleſs
where the people are Prince, as in a <hi>State Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical,</hi>
but to <hi>him</hi> only, who doth exerciſe a
Soveraignty of Dominion over the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,
in a State Monarchical, and who hath
the undoubted power of a tranſcendent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
by himſelf; In a buſineſſe of ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
the duties of the people are theſe,
ſincerely, and openly, but with all due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to preſent their juſt grievances to their
Prince, and faithfully to lay before him with what
preſent remedies they may cure thoſe evils that
oppreſs them; and humbly to beſeech him, that
he would be pleaſed to condeſcend to the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Subjects, as he ſhall judge it to be moſt
ſafe and advantagious to the Commonwealth, and
confirm the grant of them with his Royal hand.
And if he being thus petitioned to ſhall refuſe,
they are to deſiſt for that time from their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and to be content with their preſent affairs, and
Laws, and that without all murmuring or the leaſt
ſign of force, until their Prince being throughly
perſwaded by his Council, and Intreaties of
ſome friends; or induced by the arguments of
Reaſons ſhall renounce that pertinaciouſneſſe of
his Spirit, and give an open Ear to the deſires of his
Subjects.</p>
            <p>XV. The Fifth Doubt, Seeing that the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good</hi> is not only the <hi>End</hi> of the Laws, but of
the whole politick Government, Is it lawful out of
any foreſight or pretence of the <hi>Common good</hi> to
change the preſent form of Government, or to
attempt the change thereof, and <hi>how far,</hi> and to
whom is it lawful? For Examples ſake, Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:154344:181"/>
for the people to change a Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into an Ariſtocratical, or into a Democratical,
or on the contrary? A Queſtion of great difficulty, &amp;
concernment, eſpecially in theſe times, &amp; manners,
in which we live. For my part I will faithfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto you what I think of it, and will leave
unto every man the liberty to think what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;
I ſuppoſe only what is already granted by
many, and what cannot eaſily be denye, <hi>dviz.</hi> that a
Monarchy by Inheritance, or a ſucceſſive King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
is abſolutely the beſt amongſt all the forms
of Common-wealth, and highly to be preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the other two; This being granted, I think
in the firſt place, that the people, if they pleaſe,
may change a Democratical into an Ariſtocratical,
or into an Monarchical Government; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſeemeth to be a change for the better;
moreover in Democracy, the chief Command is
in the Power of the people, ſo that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of themſelves as they themſelves pleaſe,
provided that no Injury be done to any man; Now
it is moſt certain, that by this Change no Injury
is done by the people unto any one; It cannot
be to any other, for no Injury can be done to any
man in any thing to which he hath no <hi>Right,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any Injury be done herein to themſelves
who of their own accord do make this Change, for
no Injury can be ever done to a willing Perſon.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> I
think in the ſecond place, that for all theſe reaſons
the Peers of a Land alſo may turn their Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Government,<note place="margin">Ariſt. 5.</note> into a Monarchical one; For
it is a change into the better,<note place="margin">Ethic. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </note> and by ſo doing,
no injury is done to any man; But I cannot ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolve you this <hi>doubt,</hi> whether it be as lawful
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:154344:182"/>
for them to convert an Ariſtocracy into a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,
for although they have power to do it, and
it may be done by them without any injury, yet
it ſeems not to be a <hi>Commutation into a better State;</hi>
Thirdly, I believe, that the Monarchy of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
Kingdom, may be changed peradventure into
any form of Government, but eſpecially into an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
and a ſucceſſive Kingdom, and that for
almoſt the ſame Reaſons above alleged, nevertheleſs
this ought not to be done, unleſſe the Kingdom
by the death of him that laſt Reigned be vacant, for
otherwiſe it would be an injury to the preſent
King; And Secondly, it ought not to be done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
by the joynt conſent of the Peers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and People, and of thoſe perſons who have
the right of electing. I think fourthly, that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
by inheritance cannot lawfully be changed
into an Elective Kingdom, or into any other form
of Government, either by the people alone, or
by the joynt conſent of People, Peers, and King,
which is the whole people in their greateſt lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
unleſſe peradventure there ſhall be ſuch a
defect in the Royal Progeny, that there is not one
of them remaining to challenge the Kingdom due
by inheritance to him. The Reaſons of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are, Firſt, Becauſe according to our former
ſuppoſition, it were a change from a better to a
worſe; Secondly, Becauſe by reaſon of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
an apparent injury would be done to the
lawful Heir; Thirdly, Becauſe that not only the
Exchange, but becauſe ſuch a deſire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
doth ſeem to be quite contrary to
the words of <hi>Salomon, Prov. 24. 21. My Son fear
God, and the King, and have nothing to do with
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:154344:182"/>
them who affect new things.</hi> What before I ſaid,
I muſt in this place again repeat, <hi>viz.</hi> I do not urge
this as too confidently to affirm it, or to cauſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with any man in the proof of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
if he be of another judgment.</p>
            <p>XVI. The ſixth <hi>doubt,</hi> How may that be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

eſt ſuprema Lex, The ſafety of the People is
the ſupreme Law;</hi> The reaſon of the <hi>doubt</hi> doth
proceed, from that which we propounded, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>End</hi> of Laws is
the <hi>publick good;</hi> From hence on one ſide it ſeems
to follow, that the ſafety of the Common-wealth
doth depend on the ſtrict obſervance of the Laws,
and on the other ſide, that all obſervancy of the
Laws ought to give place to the ſafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
And from hence, ſome who within
theſe few years have brought a new Divinity, and a
new policy into the Church and Common-wealth,
have no leſſe confidently, than perverſely collected
and ſuggeſted, that the <hi>Liberty</hi> which they call the
<hi>Right of the Subjects</hi> (for ſo they interpret the
<hi>Safety of the People</hi>) is to be preferred above the
<hi>prerogatives</hi> of Kings, or the enacting, or eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Laws, and therefore all Regal Power and
Authority of the Laws is to ſtoop unto it. For
the reſolution of this doubt, you are to know,
that all the deceit almoſt on this vulgar Axiom, doth
ariſe from the <hi>Equivocation</hi> which lyeth hid in the
Terms, eſpecially in that word <hi>People;</hi> For the
people being a kind of a Metaphorical Body, may
be taken two wayes, as the word <hi>Body</hi> may it ſelf,
<hi>Collectively</hi> as it ſignifies the whole Commonalty
of the Republick, that is both King and Subjects,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:154344:183"/>
and <hi>Diſcretively,</hi> as it ſignifies the Subjects preciſely
by themſelves, and ſevered from the King; As when
we ſay the King, and the people; So in the word <hi>Body</hi>
ſometimes the other <hi>Members</hi> are to be underſtood
with the <hi>Head,</hi> as when we ſay the <hi>Soul</hi> and the

            <p>XVII. Firſt therefore I ſay, that moſt preciſely
and by a very evil Counſel, that is wreſted, which is
ſpoken of the people in the firſt ſence to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to them in the latter. There is no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
man will deny, that the <hi>ſafety of the people,</hi>

the <hi>ſupreme Law;</hi> But that the <hi>Safety of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
that is, of the Subjects, the King being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
is the <hi>ſupreme Law,</hi> there is no man will
affirm it, unleſs he be a fool, or an Impoſter; A fool,
if he doth believe what he himſelf ſaith, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſter,
if he doth not believe it. But if any man will
ſeriouſly look into the original of this Aphoriſm,
I do believe he will more eaſily grant, that it ought
more preciſely to be underſtood of the ſafety of the
Prince, than of the ſafety of the Subjects. This ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo toſſed up and down in the mouths of all men
came to us from the Romans, and was then uſed
by them when their Republick did flouriſh moſt
of all under a popular State: And there is no great
Reaſon that any man ſhould wonder, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Safety was the ſupreme Law with them, with
whom the people themſelves were the ſupreme
Power; In the Judgment therefore of thoſe wiſe
Antients, who were the firſt Authors of this Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:154344:183"/>
the ſafety of the <hi>ſupreme Power</hi> was the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Law, of the people indeed in a <hi>Democracy,</hi>
but of a King in <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XVIII. I ſay in the ſecond place, it being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but not granted, that this Aphoriſm is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
underſtood of the <hi>Safety of the People,</hi> that is,
of the Subjects, it is nevertheleſs perverſly wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the prejudice of Regal Dignity, which even
ſo doth render its Power more ample and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
In this ſence. A King that gives <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
to his people will not be ſo bound up by
his Laws, that it ſhall not be lawful for
him, the Safety of the Common-wealth being in an
apparent danger, to provide for the Safety of
Kingdom and people committed to him by God,
even againſt the words of the Law; Not that it is
lawful for Subjects under the pretence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their liberty to break all the bonds of Laws
and fidelity, and by an intollerable preſumption to
trample on the Authority of their King, but that it is
lawful for the Prince, in the preſervation of his own
&amp; his Subjects Safety, to lay aſide for a while all
ſtrict obſervance of the Laws, &amp; to make uſe a little
of an arbitrary Right, leſt by a too unſeaſonable, and
ſuperſtitious Reverence of the Laws, he may ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
both his own perſon, and his people that are
ſubject to him, and even the Laws themſelves,
to fall into the Power of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>XIX. I ſay in the third place, it being again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but not granted, that by this Aphoriſm
ſome licence were indulged to the Subjects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as neceſſity ſo requiring, to lay by the
Laws to provide for the publick Safety, yet from
hence that cannot be inferred, which may would
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:154344:184"/>
conclude; For it is not lawful for the Subjects, when
they find their liberty in any thing to be injured, or
when they cry out they are ſenſible of it, to break
through all Bars of Laws and Duty, and without the
knowledge of their Prince, to have immediately
their recourſe to Arms, and to fill all things with tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
&amp; ſeditions But when the defence of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
&amp; their own liberties, againſt all forein or domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Enemies, upon an urgent neceſſity doth ſo call
them to it, that a pious &amp; a prudent man would make
no doubt of it, but if the Law-maker himſelf was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
he would diſpenſe with his own Laws, it is then
lawful for the Subjects to have a greater regard of
the Common ſafety, which is the ſupreme Law, and
the end of all Laws, than to be fearful to prejudice
any particular Laws, which were therefore made
to be ſubſervient only to the publick ſafety.</p>
            <p>XX. The ſum of all is, The <hi>ſafety of the Common-wealth,</hi>
that is to ſay, of the Prince and of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
is the <hi>ſupreme Law,</hi> to which all inferiour Laws
are ſo to ſubmit, that preſent neceſſity ſo requiring,
it is lawful for the Prince by the prerogative of
his own power, yea and it is lawful for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the conſent of their Prince being according
unto reaſon preſumed, to recede ſometimes from
the words of particular Laws, to aſſiſt their indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
Country, and to be careful of its ſafety as
the ſupreme Law, but ſo, that unleſs the will and
conſent of the ſupreme power be expreſly obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or according unto reaſon preſumed, they are
not to attempt any thing under the pretence of the
publick ſafety and liberty, but what the Laws do
permit them to.</p>
            <p>XXI. There are not a few Doubts, that are
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:154344:184"/>
yet remaining, which in ſome manner do pertain
to this <hi>Final Cauſe,</hi> as concerning <hi>Privileges</hi> and
<hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> and the <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>obligation,</hi>
in the danger of life, and others of the ſame nature,
which unto ſome may peradventure appear not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to agree with the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Humane Laws;</hi>
The Solution whereof I have thought it more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for to deferre unto another time, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo long, than by too much prolixity, to tire and
to torment ſo attentive and ſo courteous an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory.</p>

you do remember it (Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

&amp; compleat this Treatiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
both the obligations of
Conſcience, to wit, the <hi>Paſſive,</hi> and
the <hi>Active;</hi> In the unfolding of the former, having in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:154344:185"/>
firſt place, and in a Scholaſtical manner excuſſed the
<hi>Definition of Conſcience,</hi> I was as elabourate as I
could be in examining, and diſcovering that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and <hi>Adequate Rule of Conſcience,</hi> from the
directions whereof, it ought to exerciſe all, and
every one of its <hi>Acts,</hi> both of <hi>Dictating,</hi> and

the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> was the <hi>principal</hi> part of that
<hi>Rule</hi> we held forth, but the <hi>Adaequate</hi> part was
that <hi>Will</hi> of God (which the School-men call <hi>the
Will of the ſign</hi>) in ſome degree made manifeſt to
every man, whether, firſt, by <hi>an inbred light,</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Practical Principles preſerved in the <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> and
known <hi>by themſelves,</hi> which the Philoſophers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Common Notions,</hi> and the Apoſtle, the Law
of God written in our hearts; Or ſecondly, by an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
inferred <hi>Light,</hi> by ſome external Revelation,
partly <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and private, to ſome ſingle
perſons, by viſions, dreams, &amp;c. at ſundry times,
and in ſundry manners; Partly <hi>ordinary,</hi> and made
publick to all mankind in the written word; Or
laſtly, by <hi>an acquired light,</hi> by concluſions rightly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and duely drawn from thoſe <hi>practical principles,</hi> or
from the <hi>written word of God,</hi> or from our own
meditations, or the Inſtitution of other men.</p>
            <p>II. I affirmed, that all theſe, and every one of
them do oblige the Conſciences of men, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe, <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>primarily by themſelves,</hi>
and by their proper virtue: for all theſe, and theſe
alone do exhibite to us the will of God, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
of himſelf, hath an abſolute, and a direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over the Conſciences of men; But I gave
you to underſtand, that there were many other
things which <hi>Secondarily,</hi> and <hi>relatively,</hi> and by
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:154344:186"/>
Virtue of the Law, or the <hi>Divine will</hi> in which
they are founded, do in their manner oblige the
Conſciences; And all of them do agree in this,
that they owe all the force of obliging which they
have to the <hi>Divine will,</hi> for otherwiſe the Divine
Law would not be the <hi>Adaequate Rule</hi> of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
nevertheleſs they do all differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
both in the <hi>Species,</hi> by reaſon of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the matter, and alſo in the <hi>degree,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the power of obliging. Moreover, there
are three degrees of <hi>thoſe</hi> who do thus oblige.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is of thoſe things whoſe obligation doth
ariſe from the Authority of another having <hi>a right
or power,</hi> in which number are Humane Laws.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is of thoſe things whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
doth ariſe from a free act of the <hi>proper
will,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Vowes, Oathes, Promiſes, and</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Spontaneous Contracts.</hi> The third degree is of thoſe
things whoſe obligation doth ariſe from the intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>brotherly Charity,</hi> in which claſſis is ranked
the Law, or the Conſideration of <hi>Scandal,</hi> or <hi>offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. As for the obligation of Humane Laws, I
have ſpoken much more than at the firſt I propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to my ſelf, yet it may be much leſs than the
weight of the thing deſerved (of which in our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Converſations there is a moſt frequent Uſe) or
the Abundance and Variety of thoſe Doubts requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which might caſt a ſcruple into the minds of
men; In the reſolution where of I proceeded ſo far
in the former Terms, that having gone over thoſe
difficulties which I thought could not improperly
be reduced to the <hi>material, efficient,</hi> and <hi>formal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Laws,</hi> in my laſt Lecture I came to treat of
thoſe which more properly did pertain to their <hi>final
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:154344:186"/>
Cauſe;</hi> where at firſt having laid this foundation for
the whole following Diſcourſe, That the <hi>good of
the Commonalty,</hi> or which is the ſame, that the
<hi>publick Peace and Happineſſe</hi> is the End of <hi>Humane
Laws,</hi> with what brevity and perſpicuity that I could
I anſwered to the ſix following Queſtions. Firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Whether there be any Uſe, or at leaſt any neceſſary
Uſe of Humane Laws in a Common-wealth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Common Good? Secondly, It belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to the Common-wealth that Vertue be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
and Vices reſtrained, whether a Law-maker
could command all the Acts, and Offices of all
Vertues, and prohibit all Vices, and Enormities
whatſoever? Which if he were not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
whether he were at leaſt bound to command
and prohibit as many as he could of either kind, by
Laws which might oblige his Subjects in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences?
Whether, and how far it be required to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the effect of the obliging of the Subjects, that the
Intent of the Law-maker be carryed to the publick
Good? Fourthly, If the Laws made already ſhall
appear leſs profitable to the publick, whether, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
how far the change of them is either to be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Prince, or to be urged by the Subject,
Fifthly, The <hi>Common good</hi> being the end of Laws,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
and even of Government it ſelf, whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and how far lawful, for the ſaid Common good,
to change the form it ſelf of the whole Government,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
or to attempt the change thereof? Laſtly how that
common ſaying, <hi>The ſafety of the People is the
ſupreme Law</hi> is to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>IV. Theſe things I thought neceſſary to repeat
more fully to you, that after ſo long an interruption
of Academical exercitations, my whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:154344:187"/>
in theſe Lectures, and the order I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therein, might better appear unto you, and
that I might recall into your memory the heads of
thoſe things which having heard before with ſo
much humanity, I juſtly do believe that in ſo long
an interval of time, you have almoſt forgotten. You
will expect I conceive, and not undeſervedly, that
I ſhould now proceed in my intended courſe, and
go directly on to thoſe next <hi>Doubts</hi> which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to be reſolved; As of thoſe of <hi>Privileges,</hi>
of <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> and to others which ſome ways
do belong to the final kind of a Cauſe. I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
it indeed and I ought to do it; But my friends
do interrupt me, they adviſe, me that the ſtubborn
and intolerable boldneſſe of ſome men do rather
efflagitate, that ſeeing ſo preciſely and ſo impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they abuſe the Aphoriſm to the publick ruine,
although I expounded it but in my laſt Lecture in
the former Term, yet that I would take it under
examination again, and open the genuine ſenſe
thereof more clearly and fully than before I had
done; This in my Conſtruction was nothing elſe
but in a new pomp of words, to do over that,
which I had done before, and to the loathing of
your Stomacks to give you that meat you before
were cloyd with. This deſire was not pleaſing to
me, but they did grow upon me with new impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to take it in hand again. It will be your
humanity to reſent and excuſe that modeſty which
I granted to my perſiſting friends, eſpecially having
uſed ſuch a prevalent Argument to overcome me
to it, not doubting but it would be grateful to the
moſt of you, if I ſhould again undertake it.</p>
            <p>V. It is therefore my preſent buſineſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:154344:187"/>
unto you what is the meaning of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Axiom, <hi>The ſafety of the people is the ſupreme
Law,</hi> and how it is to be underſtood. Some men
within theſe few years, not well imployed, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
and brought at laſt into the Common-wealth
a new ſtate of Government, as before they
had brought into the Church a new Religion, and
as they have earneſtly endeavoured under the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Conſcience,</hi> or of <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all the force and frame of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick
Government,</hi> ſo under the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence of <hi>Civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
or the <hi>liberty of the Subject,</hi> they labour in this
confuſion of times, and with incredible heat of
ſpirit, and military terrour, to ſhake, and from the
very foundation of it to pluck up the whole Fabrick
of the <hi>Government of State.</hi> Theſe as often as
they are accuſed of the Royal Dignity trod under
feet, of the deſpiſed Authority of all holy Laws, of
the diſturbance of the publick peace, of an unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and horrible tyranny exerciſed on their fellow
Subjects, all barrs of Right and Juſtice being broken
down, of an affected parity in the Church, and in
the Common-wealth, all difference of birth, and
honours, and States being taken away, and many
more ſuch Anabaptiſtical impieties, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defend themſelves, and their manners, with this
<hi>ſafety of the people,</hi> as with a Buckler, and think this
alone to be preferred to all Laws, Kings, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Cuſtoms whatſoever.</p>
            <p>VI. From ſo looſe and dangerous an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this vulgar Axiom, not only a window,
but a ſpacious door being opened to ſeditious tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and all manner of popular licence; It is
manifeſt that they who defend their horrible wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:154344:188"/>
with this forbidden buckler, do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the pure and genuine conſtruction of that
Axiom, but do feign another to themſelves, which
by an inforced Interpretation, may give ſome
ſhew of Patronage to their depraved Counſails,
and their Cauſe; For as often as any man to ſerve
his Avarice, Ambition, Hatred, or Anger ſhall
attempt new deſigns, and fill all things with Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
Blood, and Plunder, he incontinently may
pretend the Safety of the People for his nefarious
Villanie. Examine I pray you the Annals, and
Chronicles of all times throughout the world, both
ſacred, prophane, antient, modern, exotick,
or our own, you ſhall every where find that the
<hi>Catilines,</hi> and <hi>Cethegi</hi> of all times, and places, did
conſtantly practiſe theſe things, under the pretence
of liberty, and popular ſafety, <hi>ſo that he may ſeem to
have a Melonin ſtead of a Heart,</hi> (they are <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
own words) that will ſuffer himſelf to be thus
Circumvented, and deluded; But whether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily,
hath this Tempeſt hurried me, whiles I
let looſe the reigns to my juſt Indignation? I
therefore do contain my ſelf, and that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a Diſputant, and not an Orator, I return to
the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>VII. Where in the firſt place this is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
what in that vulgar Axiom is meant by
the word <hi>Safety;</hi> For it any man finds his dignity,
or liberty, affronted, or injured in ſome ſmall
thing, nay, and if it be a great one, he is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to complain that he hath endangered, or
loſt his Safety; For every <hi>Hurt,</hi> or <hi>Blemiſh</hi> is not
directly <hi>oppoſed</hi> to the <hi>Safety</hi> of any thing, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but the <hi>Ruine or Deſtruction</hi> of it. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:154344:188"/>
the ſame thing (a due Analogy being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)
in a body Politick and Republick, as
it is in a humane body, and a ſingle perſon; By
reaſon of the jarring of the contrary qualities in a
mans body, becauſe of the defect or exceſſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Heat, and Cold, and a various Immutation
of extrinſecal Accidents, it may ſo come to paſſe
that a man may hardly enjoy his health, but very
often in one part or other of his body, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that, either within, or without, which may
be very troubleſome to him, it may alſo come to
paſſe, that by the Stone, the Tooth-ach, or the
Gou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or by ſome other diſeaſe in ſome other
part, he may feel an extreme pain, or be ſo ſick
in every part that he may lye down, yet in the
mean time it may be neither neceſſary, nor ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
to have recourſe unto extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
as if he were in apparent danger of his life,
and ſafety. So in a Common-wealth, we muſt not
preſently attempt againſt the Laws, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
We muſt not gather together a rabble of the
vulgar, and raiſe tumults; we muſt not preſently
cry out <hi>Arms Arms</hi> for the ſafety of the people,
as ſoon as any popular Souldier, or bold Babler,
ſhall complain unto the people, and accuſe the
Prince, the Peers, the Magiſtrates, and Judges,
or their Miniſters, or any one of them, of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Laws, doing Injurie, or neglecting their
duties, although peradventure they have deſerved
it. There ever were, and will be under the beſt
Kings, and the beſt govern'd Common-wealths,
ſome oppreſſions of the meaner Citizens, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the abuſe of Power, and many other
grievances, for the preventing or redreſſing of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:154344:189"/>
which, no care or induſtry of the Governours, no
ſeverity of the Laws could prevail, for if it ſhall be
lawful for the factious Citizens, as ſoon as ever
they ſee one or another example of this nature, to
deſpiſe all Laws and Ordinances, and under the
pretence of the <hi>publick ſafety,</hi> to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon the oppreſſors by force of Arms;
Kingdoms and Common-wealths will never be
free from troubles and tumults; Our Saviour
ſaith, <hi>Luke. 17. 1. It cannot be avoyded but that
offences will come,</hi> and we muſt go out of the world,
as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. or ſeek ſome
Eutopia or Platonick Common-wealth to preſerve
us, if we ſhall make ſuch an Interpretation of the
ſafety of the people, that unleſs every one of the
loweſt degree of Citizens be altogether ſecure from
all unjuſt force, and unrighteous Domination of
ſome Superiour or other, there ſhall be no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
peace at all. The ſafety of the Common-wealth
is then indeed in danger, when by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
of Exotick Enemies, or by the depraeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of wicked Citizens, the affairs are brought
into ſo manifeſt a danger, that unleſs ſome timely
help be provided, the City and Country undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
will be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>VIII. We have ſeen what our Innovators do
mean by the word <hi>Safety;</hi> In the next place we are
to obſerve how rightly that word <hi>People</hi> is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them. The People as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> defines
them from the loſt books of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Repub.</hi> is

<hi>Patricians, Knights,</hi> and the <hi>Common people;</hi> But in
what a latitude this word is to be received amongſt
the Latine writers whereſoever it is found, the
Reader may collect by the adjoyned circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which for the moſt part for a moſt ſure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for this purpoſe may beſt be done by thoſe
words which are annexed, <hi>viz.</hi> the oppoſite Terms.
The word <hi>People</hi> is taken three wayes by the
Roman Writers; Firſt (and of all the moſt unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual)
it is taken for the Common People alone,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which was the loweſt order of the People of <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
as in that of <hi>Martial,</hi>
               <q xml:lang="lat">Dat populus, dat gratus eques, dat thura Senatus.</q>
Where the word <hi>People</hi> being oppoſed to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and the Knights, can ſignifie nothing but
the Common-People. Secondly, for both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
orders of People, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common People,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and the Knights together, the Supreme or Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
order being excluded; For in the beginning
of the conſtitution of that Common-wealth, the
Kings being expelled, the Fathers thought good
to retain among themſelves, a kind of Prerogative
of Honour, and Dignity above other Citizens,
and for the ſignification of it, to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by that name from the reſt of the <hi>Turba</hi>
of the People; From whence came thoſe ſolemn
Forms; <hi>The Senate, and the People of</hi> Rome; <hi>It
ſeemed good to the Senate, and the People of</hi> Rome;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:154344:190"/>
In which the name of <hi>People</hi> doth comprehend all
the other Citizens, both Knights, and Common-People,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Senate excepted. Thirdly, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for all the Citizens of all degrees without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
both <hi>Fathers, Knights,</hi> and <hi>Common-People,</hi>
for of theſe three orders, after that
Kings deſiſted, and there were as yet no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
the whole City did conſiſt; And in this
ſence (for in the whole duration of that Common-wealth,
the State was popular) the Roman wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are to be underſtood, as often as they make
mention of the preſerving of the <hi>Safety, Dignity,</hi> and
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> of the people.</p>
            <p>IX. I have the more diligently expounded theſe
things, not only becauſe the proper ſignifications
of many words of this kind do depend on the uſe
of that people, from whom the words themſelves
are derived to us, but for another two fold Cauſe;
The one, that we ſuffer not our ſelves to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and circumvented by a leſſe proper interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a doubtful word; The other, that in the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> bare appellation of the word <hi>people,</hi> there may be
no force to the prejudice of him who is Prince of
the Commonalty, and the head of the people;
Either of which, of what moment they are to our
preſent purpoſe, you ſhall preſently underſtand by
thoſe things which I am to prefer unto you.</p>
            <p>X. I ſay therefore that this word <hi>people</hi> (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other words, ſignifying an aggregate multitude)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> may be taken two wayes; Either <hi>collectively,</hi> as it
ſignifieth the whole Commonalty of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that is the Prince and Subjects together, or
<hi>diſcretively</hi> and <hi>preciſely,</hi> as it ſignifieth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
only, and ſevered from the King; In the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:154344:190"/>
ſame manner, as the Body either implyes the
reſt of the Members with the Head, or the reſt
of the Members without the Head; And the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
of a Family, doth ſometimes compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all who are within one Houſe, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Servants, and the Maſter of the Family him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who is over them all, and ſometimes again
thoſe only who are under his command, and of
whom he hath care; And in the name of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
ſometimes the General is comperhended
with the Souldiers, ſometimes he is not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
And the like is to be obſerved in the
words of <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and other words
of the ſame kind, which ſignifie indeed a collection
of many, but with order and reference to one as
their principal, or their Head. Therefore if not
with a malignant intent, yet certainly by a moſt
dangerous Error it comes to paſſe, that that which is
ſpoken of the <hi>people collectively</hi> in the former ſenſe,
incluſively to comprehend the whole Commonalty,
that is, the Prince with the Subjects, ſhould be ſo
wreſted, that it ſhould be applyed to the people
in the latter ſenſe, that is, to the Subjects alone,
the King excluded.</p>
            <p>XI. But you will ſay, how may it appear to us
that the Appellation of people in the firſt ſence,
may in that Axiom be underſtood <hi>collectively</hi> for the
King and people, and not <hi>diſcretively,</hi> in the
later ſence for the common people alone? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that moſt manifeſtly it doth appear by the
common uſe of ſpeaking, and the Analogy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words of the ſame ſignification; In which the
moſt certain rule of Interpretation is, that words
<hi>collective</hi> are alwayes to be taken <hi>collectively,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:154344:191"/>
the Adjunct which is oppoſite to it, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it. For examples ſake, where it is ſaid, 1
<hi>Col. 1. 18. Chriſt is the Head of the Body of the
Church;</hi> It is manifeſt by the Adjunct oppoſite to
it, to wit, the mention of the <hi>Head,</hi> to which
the Body is there relatively oppoſed, that the word
<hi>Body</hi> is there taken <hi>diſcretively</hi> for the other
Members of the body, preciſely ſevered from the
<hi>Head;</hi> So if any man ſhould ſay that the General
had advanced with his Army into the Fields, or
had ſent them to their winter quarters, or that the
Maſter of a Family had forbad any belonging to
him to go out of his doors at twelve of the Clock
at night; Or what is written of <hi>David,</hi> That
whatſoever the King did, was acceptable to the
<hi>people;</hi> It is manifeſt by the Adjunct every
where oppoſed, that in the word <hi>General,
maſter,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> thoſe collective words of
<hi>Army, Family,</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<hi>collectively,</hi> but <hi>diſcretively</hi> and <hi>excluſively</hi>
that is, by the appellation of the Army, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
are only comprehended, and not the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and by the appellation of Family, the Servants
or Children are comprehended, and not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
himſelf, and by the appellation of people, the
Subjects are only comprehended, and not the
King; The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Oppoſite,</hi> which
is one of the <hi>correlatives,</hi> being adjoyned, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
imply the word <hi>collective,</hi> anſwering on
the other ſide, and relatively oppoſite unto it, to
contain preciſely its <hi>correlative,</hi> that is, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
only annexed and conjoyned to the <hi>Head,</hi>
and <hi>chief,</hi> and not the whole Commonalty aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
as it were from both the <hi>Terms correlative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:154344:191"/>
XII. But when an Oppoſite is not added which
may neceſſarily carry its ſignification to the other
part of the Relation only, it were incongruous to
ſence and reaſon to take the <hi>word collective.</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than <hi>collectively,</hi> and in its juſt latitude, ſo that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t may thereby comprehend both the Terms of the
<hi>Relations,</hi> eſpecially when the ſpeech is concerning
<hi>ſafety, profit,</hi> or any other good or advantage
which is or mat be common to them both; for
examples ſake, if it were commanded that to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow
the camp ſhould march becauſe the Army
ſhould not be invironed by the Enemy, or that
Corn ſhould be bought for the preſent uſe of a Family,
Orectes himſelf would ſwear that the man
was not of a ſober underſtanding, who ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that what was ſpoken either of the Army
or the Family had relation only to the good of the
Souldiers, and the Servants, no account or care
being had of the General who commanded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
nor of the Maſter who governed the Family;
which is all one as if a ſick man being admoniſhed
by the Phyſician to have a greater care of his body
for the future, ſhould with a great diligence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to keep warm his Breaſt, and his Thighs, and
other members beneath his neck, but take no care
at all to provide for his head, becauſe the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
did only put him in mind of his body but not
of his head.</p>
            <p>XIII. But I come yet nearer to the point in
hand, if Peradventure a whole company of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers ſhould affirm that <hi>the ſafety of the
Army was the ſupreme Law military,</hi> but they had
a General who did put them upon ſuch hard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
by his unſufferable commands that unleſſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:154344:192"/>
they timely ſhould ſhake off the yoak of obedience
to him, the whole liberty of the Army would be
in great danger to be loſt, and thereupon from this
Principle of aſſerting their own liberties by force
of Arms, they ſhould conſult and agree amongſt
themſelves, no longer to obey his commands, but to
take away the life of their General; Or if houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Servants, (whom the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 18.
would have obedient not only to thoſe who are
good, and favourable to them, but to thoſe alſo
who are rough and rigorous,) ſhould combine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, to refuſe his commands as too
burthenſome, and therefore becauſe too inſolently
he domineereth over them to drive him out of his
houſe, to ſeize upon his Keys, Truncks, and all
his goods, and to mannage themſelves the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Family at their own pleaſure, under
this pretence only, that <hi>The ſafety of the Family is
the ſupreme Law oeconomical,</hi> There is no man but
will confeſſe but that theſe wicked and nefarious
Counſels, may by ſome lawful conſequence be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from theſe Principles, which Principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly underſtood are moſt true and profitable;
And yet an egge is not more like unto an egge,
than the Arguments of thoſe men, who by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the peoples ſafety fill all things with ſedition,
are to this wild kind of reaſoning, as if (and that
very eminently alſo,) the ſafety of the General
were not contained and included in the ſafety of
the Army; and the ſafety of the Maſter in the
ſafety of his Family, and the ſafety of a Prince in
the ſafety of his people. To be ſhort, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<hi>the ſafety of the People,</hi> that is of
the King and People together, is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:154344:192"/>
Law, but the ſafety of the People, that is, of
the Subjects, the King being excluded, is not ſo.</p>
            <p>XIV. In the ſecond place I am to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more; And though I conceive that I have
clearly enough proved, that in this Axiom by the
word <hi>People</hi> neither the Subjects without the
Prince, nor the Prince without the Subjects ought
preciſely and by themſelves to be underſtood, but
both of them conjunctively, yet if any man will
more exactly conſider either the dignity of the
perſons, or the original of this Aphoriſm, he will
willingly grant it to be underſtood more preciſely
of the ſafety of the King, than preciſely of the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the People; For firſt, that the Kings Majeſty
is ſacred hath not been only moſt copiouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all the Fathers of the Church even
at that time when there were no Chriſtian Kings,
who have reverenced them as men ſecond to God,
and leſſe only than God himſelf, and have offered
Vows, and Prayers unto God for their ſafety, and
have taught that on their ſafety, the ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of the whole people did depend; But God
himſelf (as largely may be ſhown if need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
hath been pleaſed that abundantly it ſhould
be teſtified in the holy Scriptures; From whence
it came to paſſe, that all good Subjects and endued
with a right underſtanding, in the height, and heat,
and the extremeſt danger of Battel, have judged
that the ſafety of the King alone, was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
above the ſafety to them all, which as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
good Subjects, thoſe Iſraelites gallantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
who at the time of the execrable Conſpiracy
of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> preſerved their fidelity which they vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to King <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 18. 3. And of the ſame
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:154344:193"/>
mind were they, who (not baſely flattering a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
man for their own profit, but ſpeaking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Dictates of the Spirit of God) have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the King the breath of their noſtrils, for ſo that
godly Prophet, and ſanctified from his mothers
womb, the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaketh it, <hi>Lamen.</hi>
4. 20. In a moſt apt ſignification, That breath
which is attracted, and emitted through the noſtrils
being that vital breath,<note place="margin">Animus R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

a Bond is united to the Body, and which failing, the
living Creature muſt forthwith neceſſarily expire
and periſh; His Breath goeth forth, he returneth to

            <p>XV. This alſo is worthy your obſervation, that
the Axiom of which we now treat, hath been
brought unto us from the Roman Nation, and
then in uſe with them, when <hi>Rome</hi> did moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in a popular ſtate. And there is no reaſon we
ſhould wonder, <hi>That the ſafety of the people was to
them a ſupreme Law, to whom the people themſelves
were the ſupreme Power. The Lawes</hi> were then the
<hi>Peoples,</hi> the <hi>judgments</hi> the <hi>Peoples,</hi> the whole <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction</hi>
the <hi>Peoples,</hi> the entire Government and
<hi>autocratical Majeſty</hi> was the <hi>Peoples.</hi> And from
hence it is, that amongſt all the Hiſtorians, and
in <hi>Cicero</hi> alſo and other Writers of that age, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
a mention is made of the majeſty of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
people, as being in a ſtate <hi>Democratical,</hi> which
in a ſtate <hi>Monarchical</hi> is not the <hi>Peoples</hi> but the
<hi>Kings.</hi> Therefore, as much as the ſafety of the
People was to them, with whom was the Majeſty
of the People, which how much it was, by the
Aphoriſm they would it ſhould be teſtified to the
world, ſo much unto us if we will make uſe of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:154344:193"/>
of that Aphoriſm (an Analogy in the ſo different
forms of both Republicks being rightly obſerved,
as fit it ſhould be ſo) ſhould be the ſafety of our
Kings who acknowledge no other majeſty but the
Kings, only.</p>
            <p>XVI. From theſe things which have been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
I believe it is manifeſt enough, that neither
in the appellation of <hi>Safety,</hi> nor in the appellation of
<hi>People</hi> there is any force at all in this vulgar Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om,
as to wreſt it to the prejudice of Kingly dignity,
unleſs with the greateſt injury that can be done unto
it; And if the two other remaining words of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
The <hi>ſupreme Law</hi> ſhould be rightly weighed, they
would acknowledge I believe if they had but any
Modeſty, or Reaſon, that nothing can be ſpoken in
this Axiom which is more ample and illuſtrious to
eſtabliſh the ſoveraign Power of Kings; For theſe
words the <hi>ſupreme Law</hi> do ſuppoſe that in every
Common-wealth there ought neceſſarily to be
ſomewhere a ſoveraign Power which is above all
humane Laws poſitive,<note place="margin">

and by his Authority to take care, that neither by the
defect of Laws, or the too ſuperſtitious obſervance
of them, the Common-wealth may receive any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
And the reaſon of this is plain enough, for
the wiſeſt Law-maker cannot ſo foreſee all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of events to come, neither can he make ſuch
a ſufficient precaution by the Laws, as to prevent
all thoſe Evils, &amp; inconveniencies which he ſuſpects
may come to paſs; and this is not by the fault of the
Laws, or of the Law-makers, but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath
excellently obſerved it, it is by reaſon of the nature
of thoſe things that are to be defined by the Laws

XVIII. As to that Queſtion, whether a Ptince be
free himſelf from the Laws he hath made, &amp; which
are confirmed, and approved by the Conſent of the
People, &amp; received by common Uſe, and how far he
is bound, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> to obſerve them, I ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(God willing) give you my Judgement therein;
It is now only here demanded, whether it be
lawful for him, <hi>without order,</hi> and in <hi>caſe of neceſſity,</hi>
for the defence of his Country, to do ſome thing
either beſides, or againſt the <hi>Law it ſelf?</hi> That it is
lawful for him ſo to do, and that in good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he may do it, it is firſt proved by the Examples
of the beſt Kings, and by the Hiſtories of all Nations
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that have been remarkable throughout the world.
And ſecondly, Reaſon it ſelf doth dictate it from
<hi>the defect of the Laws in respect of the whole,</hi> and from
the uncertainty and multiplicity of particular events,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> both which but even now I mentioned. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thoſe things do ſufficiently prove it which are
all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which cannot well be interpreted otherwiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
many in vain have attempted ſo to do. But
that the leaſt ſcruple may not ariſe, nor remain from
any thing which hath here been ſpoken, and is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood,
Give me leave I pray you to call back
this ſo divulged an <hi>Axiom</hi> to its firſt <hi>Original;</hi>
And if I ſhall not ſo perform it, that you your
ſelves may confeſſe, that the <hi>Care of the publick
ſafety,</hi> the Laws ſomtimes laid aſide doth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the meaning and ſence of the <hi>Axiom</hi> it ſelf,

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:154344:195"/>
and Betrayer of the beſt of Cauſes.</p>
            <p>XIX I have declared already, that this <hi>Axiom</hi>
was derived from the Romans unto us; I ſhall now
add that which <hi>firſt of all</hi> (as I know of) is written
in the firſt Book of <hi>Marcus Cicero de Legib.</hi> But by
himſelf as he affirmeth taken out of the antient
Laws of that Nation, and deſcribed by him in the
very word of the Law it ſelf; Having therefore in
the former explained the Laws belonging to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the worſhip of the Gods, in his third
Book he proceeds to give an account of thoſe which
belong to the Magiſtrates, and Common-wealth.
Where amongſt other things he hath theſe words,
I muſt beſeech you to give due attention to them,

I anſwer, in this nature, the Subjects may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to act ſomething of themſelves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Princes conſent, if an urgent and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
neceſſity doth require, for <hi>neceſſity</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
ſpeaks it, <hi>hath no Law.</hi> I deny nevertheleſs,
that from this aſſertion that may be done which
ſome would have to be done. I ſay therefore in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the firſt place, that whatſoever right can accrew
unto the Subjects upon this aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That
all Laws being neglected they ſhould themſelves
provide for the publick ſafety, doth come unto
them upon another account, for it can no ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the authority of this preſent Aphoriſm as on
its foundation which leaves unto the Prince alone
the care of providing for the publick ſafety, and
doth not permit it to the people; Again, it is one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
thing to attempt a thing againſt the publick Laws
the Prince not knowing it, and another thing
to do it, the Prince not willing to it, for one of
the two may lawfully be done upon due conditions,
but the other is abſolutely unlawful. I ſay in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
ſecond place, that if the Subjects will attempt any
thing in order to the publick ſafety, <hi>two things</hi> above
all other muſt moſt preciſely be obſerved, and he
who ſhall neglect either of them cannot defend
himſelf by any excuſe of neceſſity, and how religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
they have obſerved them, who have been
the Authors or Fomentors of the moſt deplorable
troubles in this Kingdom, I forbear in this place
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:154344:197"/>
to make mention of, let them look to that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
The two conditions are theſe; Firſt that no
thing be done, or attempted to be done, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Prince, whoſe perſon &amp; whoſe dignity
it pertains to the publick ſafety to be moſt careful
to preſerve inviolable; Secondly, that nothing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be attempted againſt the Laws and Rights of
the Kingdom,<note place="margin">In mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtis non opus eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, ſed executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. <hi>Aquin. 2. 2 qu. 120. art.</hi> 2.</note> but by the Princes conſent, either his
expreſs conſent, where conveniently it may be
had, or at leaſt <hi>reaſonably preſumed;</hi> if he be at a
great diſtance, and the affair admits of no delay,
the conſent of the Prince is then <hi>reaſonably preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
when the neceſſity is ſo great and evident that
no wiſe or ſober man can doubt, but if the
Prince himſelf were preſent he would grant
unto his Subjects a relaxation of that Law.</p>
            <p>XXI. Theſe two conditions being obſerved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
there ariſeth no impediment from particular
Circumſtances,<note place="margin">certum est omnia li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere pro patria. <hi>Quintil. declam.</hi> 369.</note> I ſay it is lawful for Subjects for the
defence of the <hi>ſafety of the Prince, &amp; of themſelves,</hi>
if it be againſt the Invaſion of Forein, or the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Domeſtick Enemies, to look more to the
common profit which is <hi>the ſupreme Law,</hi> than to
the letter of particular Laws, which are therefore
made to ſerve the publick profit, and not to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
it; The reaſon is evident, for <hi>middle things</hi>
are for the <hi>end,</hi> and not the <hi>end</hi> for <hi>middle things,</hi>
and therefore theſe <hi>middle things</hi> ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to the <hi>end,</hi> and not the <hi>end</hi> to them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing the <hi>publick ſafety</hi> hath under it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the <hi>End,</hi> and the Laws, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of <hi>middle things,</hi> and ſeeing it is certain,
that in the Intention of the <hi>Agent,</hi> the <hi>End</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and more to be reſpected than all <hi>middle things</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:154344:197"/>
are or can be, it muſt follow, both that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
profit of our Country is to be preferred above
all particular Laws, and that rightly it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
that the Prince is of the ſame opinion,
who is <hi>Principal Agent</hi> in making of Laws, and
therefore whatſoever herein is done in his abſence,
or to be done, he tacitely doth conſent unto it,
(provided his own <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
a manifeſt neceſſity doth exact it for the
publick ſafety.</p>
            <p>XXII. The Hiſtories are full of examples to
prove this, but the reaſon of it being ſo manifeſt, I
purpoſely paſs them by as ſuperfluous; I will only
produce one, but an Illuſtrious one, and worthy to
be inſerted into the Annals of this Nation for the
eternal memory of the Gentleman, and which was
done alſo in this age, and in the memory of ſome
here preſent; It was the remarkable act of the
high Sheriff of <hi>Worcesterſhire;</hi> To put the Laws in
execution, and chiefly for the preſervation of the
publick peace, there is an yearly Magiſtrate called
a high Sheriff, ſet over all the Shires of <hi>England,</hi>
to this Magiſtrate for the undergoing of ſo great
an Office, there is granted by the Laws of the
Land, the power of ſummoning the trained Bands
to aſſiſt him as often as need requireth, to go
with him, to diſcover and ſuppreſſe any Tumults,
and Diſorders, that may happen in any place of his
County, but ſo, that it is not lawful for him to go
with the ſaid trained Bands beyond the Terms and
bounds of his own County; After that by the
great and wonderful mercy of God the Powder
Treaſon was diſcovered, ſome who were conſcious
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:154344:198"/>
of that Conſpiracy, and one or two of the chiefeſt
of them did fly into <hi>Worceſterſhire;</hi> the high She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,
a gallant and prudent man, did follow them
as they fled from place to place with the trained
Bands, and being come to the uttermoſt confines
of his County, he feared if he ſhould make a halt
there, and purſue them no further, by reaſon of the
fear of the Laws, they might eſcape away, he
was therefore ſo venturous that for all the Law
he brought the trayned Bands into the County that
was contigious to it, where having overtaken the
Traitors, he reduced them unto his Power, and
took along with him the Ringleaders of them, with
the reſt of that deſperate Rabble; He conceived
to himſelf (as indeed he ought to do) if he ſhould
throughly perform the duty of a good Subject, he
could never expreſs it in a more honourable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and in that point of Neceſſity the more ſtrict
obſervance of the Laws was unſeaſonable, he was
therefore to obey the <hi>ſupreme Law,</hi> that is to ſay,
<hi>the ſafety of his Country,</hi> and to diſregard all things
in reſpect to the <hi>publick profit.</hi> The Buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus diſpatched according to his own Deſire,
the wiſe and active Gentleman, leaſt the Authority
of the Laws ſhould be diſparaged by his Example,
which indeed was to be imputed to Neceſſity, and
being ſenſible withal to how greivous a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they are lyable in the <hi>Rigor</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> who
are the violators of it, believed he had not done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to acquieſce in the conſciouſneſſe only of
what he had atchieved, unleſſe withal he had made
a proviſion for his ſafety for the Time to come, and
took as much care as in him lay, that no man ſhould
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:154344:198"/>
abuſe his Example, by (peradventure) too bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
undertaking of any new Deſign. He therefore
poſts away unto King <hi>James</hi> of happy memory,
and proſtrating himſelf at his feet, he humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
pardon for the violation of the Law, and as
he deſerved, he not only from the moſt prudent
King obtained <hi>pardon</hi> for the not obſervance of
the Law, but <hi>praiſe</hi> for preferring the publick ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
above it.</p>
            <p>XXIII. To give ſatisfaction to ſome friends, I
have here (my Auditors) expounded to you a little
more largely then my Cuſtome is, what is the ſence
of that <hi>Axiom Salus populi ſuprema Lex. The
ſafety of the people is the ſupreme Law,</hi> and to ſtop
withal, the Mouths of ſome importunate Men,
who to ſpeak with <hi>Solomon</hi> do force blood from
the too much wringed Noſe, that is, by miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
a pious <hi>ſaying,</hi> and indeed (if it be rightly
underſtood) ſalubrious to the <hi>publick,</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
render it impious, and deſtructive unto <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
To be ſhort the ſum of all is this, If ſome
private perſons be hurt or injured, If the Subjects
have ſome publick Grievances of which they juſtly
may complain, they muſt not preſently have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
(as if the ſafety of the people were in the
extremeſt Jeopardy) to extraordinary Remedyes,
and which are <hi>contrary to the Laws;</hi> But if there
be a juſt fear that the Common-wealth will be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
either by forein Enimyes, or ſeditious
Subjects, unleſs ſomthing be effected which is not
permited by the Laws, It is then lawful for the
<hi>Prince</hi> by the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of his own Power, nay,
it is lawful for the <hi>Subjects</hi> by the <hi>preſumed Will</hi> of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:154344:199"/>
their Prince (provided nothing be acted to
his prejudice, and the preſent exigence of
Neceſſity ſo requireth) to recede from the
word and ſence of particular Laws to aſſiſt
the <hi>endangered Country,</hi> and to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the <hi>ſafety</hi> thereof, as to the <hi>ſupremeſt
Law.</hi> I ſhall ſuddenly proceed to proſecute
the reſt, as God ſhall permit and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
ſhall inable me. <hi>The Grace of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I have committed the Sayls unto
the Winds, although in a bluſtring ſeaſon,
and the face of Heaven being masked with
many Clouds, (yet God being my Pilot)
I ſafely proceeded in my intended courſe,
and now I did begin to ſtand more off to
Sea, being reſolved if the Times would give
me leave, to have reached the deſired Port,
when behold a ſuddain and over-powering Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
did over my head admoniſh me, that
for the time to come it would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to adventure further, or to continue
ploughing through theſe unquiet Deeps, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
therefore that new Counſels were forthwith
to be taken, and unleſs I would be come the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and ſport of the Winds, I muſt no
longer ſtay on ſuch a dangerous and ſuch a
vaunting Sea; I ſuddenly therefore tacked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and timely brought my Ship into the
Haven, for it ſeemed to me more honourable
gradually to retreat, than to be beaten back
by force, and more profitable for my affairs
to live within my own doors with <hi>eaſe</hi> and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:154344:199"/>
               <hi>umbrage,</hi> than to be ſeen in the Market
place, or on the Theatre, attended with <hi>noyſe,</hi>
and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>envy.</hi>
